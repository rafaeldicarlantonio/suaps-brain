**To**: Directors and Members of the Advisory Board 
**From**: Dr Michael C. Cifone | Founder & Executive Director/CEO 
**Date**: 16 April 2025 
**Subject**: Strategic Developments, Research Initiatives, and Upcoming Leadership Agenda 
**I. Introduction** 
Colleagues, 
I write to share a major update on the organizational evolution, strategic expansion, and research planning now underway at the _Society for UAP Studies_. As we continue to solidify our foundational infrastructure, I want to ensure you’re fully informed about our latest developments, including newly emerging opportunities in research planning and donor engagement. This memo outlines our progress, current initiatives, and the next steps that will require your attention and participation. 
**II. Organizational Maturation** 
Over the past several months, we have advanced considerably in formalizing the Society’s internal structure and leadership roles. This includes the establishment of distinct operational, programmatic, development, and publishing divisions—all now overseen by appointed directors or under active recruitment. The core structure now includes: 
● **Programmatic Division**: Research, education, events, outreach, international relations ● **Operational Division**: Internal systems, marketing, digital communications ● **Publishing Division**: _Limina: The Journal of UAP Studies_ and initial planning for SUAPS Press 
● **Development & Grants Division**: Grant cultivation, compliance, donor engagement and broader revenue development strategizing
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 2 
_A visual representation of this architecture is included below._ 
�� **Organizational Chart** 
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe3PkV8jEZzue9ciEGMxfvjZGCPftory3JUMtarnR4Gqzi-1FqnUfSVYYJRDr_Fykg3LKNYaKsL5GKRYphwkJQ1RZnpNKoRQWXGrQlFimKz09ATEntCeenxuZqdFpF4SW0vqgGViA?key=UVZ4a3cQHoknLhNWSeDvOw)
**Leadership Updates** 
**Confirmed and Active Directors:** 
● Director of Research Programs 
● Director of Education & Curriculum Development 
● Director of Community Outreach & Engagement 
● Director of Academic Publications 
● Director of Operations 
● Director of Latin American Outreach 
● Incoming Director of European Outreach
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 3 
**Provisional Appointments:** 
● Director of Research Grants Development & Administration (beginning May 2025) **Approved but Not Yet Filled:** 
● Development Director 
● Grants & Compliance Officer 
● Director of Marketing (responsibilities currently covered by Public Relations Coordinator) _● and several more_ 
_These are a selection of roles already approved as part of our strategic staffing roadmap. Additional leadership and coordinator positions will be introduced as the Society grows._ 
**Governance Context** 
SUAPS operates under a governance structure where the Board of Directors provides strategic oversight, the Executive Director (CEO) and divisional leadership manage operations, and two advisory bodies support our mission: 
● **Advisory Council (AC):** Formerly known as the “Executive Council” during early planning, this non-binding advisory group will be composed of members appointed by the Executive Director/CEO. It will eventually transition to an **elected body**. The AC plays a central role in shaping the Society’s strategic posture and programmatic evolution, particularly in research alignment and public identity formation. 
● **Advisory Board (AB):** An honorific body appointed by the Board of Directors in recognition of distinguished scholarly or professional contributions. Members are not expected to assume operational duties but may lend their expertise or visibility where appropriate. 
The Society’s Charter, which formally codifies these roles and institutional governance, will be submitted for ratification at an upcoming general meeting. We have worked hard to simplify but clarify this important document. 
**III. Research Portfolio Development** 
We are excited to announce the launch of an **Integrated Research Portfolio Initiative**. This is an open call to all Society-affiliated scholars, investigators, and collaborators to **submit independent or team-based research proposals** by **October 1, 2025**.
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 4 
Submissions will form the foundation for: 
● A **unified research dossier** representing the Society’s collective intellectual capacity; ● A **cohesive narrative of scientific rigor and innovation** across UAP-related disciplines; ● A **pitch-ready portfolio** to be shared with select donors, research allies, and the broader public. 
**Sample Research Domains:** 
● Phenomenology and Observation 
● Theoretical Models and Physics 
● Experiential and Psychological Studies 
● Historical and Archival Investigations 
● Social, Political, and Disclosure Analysis 
Proposals will be reviewed by the **Director of Research Programs**, the **Director of Research Grants Development & Administration**, and the **Director of Operations**. A standardized proposal form and collaborative review workflow are in development. 
A final dossier will be compiled by internal leadership and used for: 
● Donor pitch decks and funding conversations 
● Public branding and outreach 
● Strategic alignment across programmatic areas 
This initiative reflects SUAPS’ long-term commitment to scholarly legitimacy, research coherence, and institutional narrative. 
To facilitate integration, we are encouraging the inclusion of members’ separate **institutional affiliations**, where applicable and non-conflictual. Our internal team—including the **Director of Research Programs**, the **Director of Research Grants Development & Administration**, and the **Director of Operations**—will provide feedback and logistical support throughout the process. 
We will also be introducing: 
● A **standardized research proposal submission form** 
● A streamlined **internal review workflow** 
● And an eventual **Research Portfolio Master Dossier** for donor and media outreach 
This is a critical step in shaping the **public research identity of SUAPS**, helping to define our “brand” and scope as an academic society grounded in professional scholarly standards and exploratory openness.
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 5 
**IV. Strategic Financial Foundation** 
Following the approval of our **FY2025 Master Budget**, we now operate from a fully-articulated financial framework – at an **aspirational $4.5M** – that supports: 
● Personnel stipends for critical roles 
● Core programmatic infrastructure 
● Community engagement efforts 
● A dual-track research funding model (Society-directed and donor-directed projects) ● Aspirational funding for fellowships, competitive grants, and future initiatives 
A visual breakdown is available here: 
�� **Budget Allocation Chart** 
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvdKjdh_KlHk2w_rIaSJta5GeMobV7bHALCCs_E68IBP-iM3EvG2DXliVHlQjmRlMLUAso7Fv1P3ZtGBm4ZQB4R5KR-w5U76-9oYYl1kU7knlxTk3JnrNvRAB7nRhY-mvaF2X9kA?key=UVZ4a3cQHoknLhNWSeDvOw)**Financial Position and Funding Strategy** 
SUAPS currently operates with **limited resources**, carefully stewarded to support foundational growth. Our aspirational FY2025 budget is structured around this **$4.5M target**, guiding our financial planning.
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 6 
**Funding Strategy:** 
● Diversified donor streams (individuals, foundations, institutions) 
● Strong mission alignment and independence 
● Scalable programming design 
● Balanced restricted and unrestricted funds 
**Grassroots Support Goal:** We aim to establish a donor base of approximately **95K community supporters** at **$4/month**, forming a sustainable, public-backed revenue foundation. Adjustments will be made based on supporter behavior and market responsiveness. 
We are also in early discussions regarding a **confidential donor-directed research initiative**, which has motivated the creation of our internal grants administration infrastructure and the broader research portfolio project; this may constitute a reliable source of funding for the administration costs of the Society to sustain such an endeavor. 
**V. Stakeholder and Institutional Engagements** 
SUAPS is not pursuing formal institutional partnerships. Instead, and per Advisory Board input from prior general meetings, we are developing informal but structured collaborations where alignment is clear and mission-consistent. 
The newly-forming **Advisory Council** will be consulted on such engagements as they approach the potential for operational maturity. This practice underscores the Council’s strategic and consultative role within our leadership structure. 
International Outreach: 
● Current focus: Latin America and Europe 
● Future priority regions: Africa, Middle East, Asia-Pacific 
● Goal: Close global gaps in UAP encounter data, research practices, and discourse through strategic regional engagement
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 7 
**VI. Communications and Public Identity** 
SUAPS is investing in a research-forward public identity through: 
● Professional PR coordination and digital presence 
● Independent publishing through _Limina_ 
● Cohesive branding across all research and outreach efforts 
Our communications strategy will seek to emphasize: 
● Academic integrity and independence 
● Transparency and accessibility 
● SUAPS’ emergence as a credible scholarly institution 
**VII. Upcoming Milestones and Key Dates** 
● Now–September 2025 
○ Finalize leadership roles 
○ Refine proposal intake workflows 
● October 1, 2025 
**○ Integrated Research Portfolio submissions due** 
● October–November 2025 
○ Internal review and compilation of proposals 
○ Drafting of pitch materials and public presentation frameworks 
● Late Summer or Early Fall 2025 
○ General meeting 
○ Charter ratification 
○ Advisory Council structure confirmation
_Memorandum 12 April 2025 –_ 8 
**VIII. Closing** 
I want to express my deep gratitude to each of you for your continued commitment, insight, and belief in the mission of SUAPS. This next phase represents not only a deepening of our structural capacity but also a bold stride toward global scholarly engagement and institutional recognition. 
Please feel encouraged to reach out to me directly with any questions, proposal ideas, or suggestions. I look forward to our upcoming discussions and to formalizing our collective vision together. 
In solidarity and inquiry, 
**Mike Cifone** 
Founder & Executive Director / CEO

# Switching to ClickUp – Communication

Hi, team.

We’re shifting every action, due date, file, and decision into ClickUp. Here’s why the move matters and how it will help you work faster.
* * *
### 1\. What ClickUp is
*   "The everything app for work".
*   Combines tasks, files, comments, and due dates in a single page.
*   Works in any browser; no extra software.
Think of it as “Slack chat + Google Drive + calendar reminders + To-do list + video recording” all rolled together.
* * *
### 2\. What “project management” really means
*   Decide what has to be done.
*   Assign who will do it.
*   Agree when it’s due.
*   Track progress until it’s finished.
That’s it. Simple, but organizations that work this way see 74 % of projects hit their goals vs. 48 % when they don’t use a formal method.
* * *
### 3\. Why switching speeds us up

| Pain today | How ClickUp fixes it |
| ---| --- |
| Tasks buried in Slack threads | Every action becomes a visible task with an owner |
| Slow decisions | Priorities (_Urgent / High / Normal / Low_) show what matters right now |
| “Which file is current?” | Each task stores the latest doc or link—no more hunting |
| Missed deadlines | Dashboards flag anything overdue, so issues surface fast |

Fewer questions → faster cycle time → more energy for real work.
* * *
### 4\. How we’ll work from now on
1. Create or update a ClickUp task for every request that needs action.
2. Set the Priority so everyone sees the urgency.
3. Use Slack only for quick chat. If a decision is made, drop it into the task comment.
4. Check “My Work” in ClickUp daily—your personal to-do list sorted by priority.
* * *
### 5\. Next steps
*   Watch this 3-minute intro video to see ClickUp in action: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3v1zR5pchM&t=12s)[_\[video link\]_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3v1zR5pchM&t=12s)
*   Need an account? Reply to me directly and I’ll set you up today.
*   Department not visible yet? Your area probably isn’t configured. Ping me to book a quick call so I can learn your workflow and build the right ClickUp space.
*   Questions? Post them in [#suaps-hub](https://slack.com/archives/C08L1HEPPV5) so everyone learns at once.

Let’s cut the clutter and move faster together!

# Core Values

Use this section to outline the core values or principles that guide your organizational culture and decision-making processes.

* * *

![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/d4fba381-5092-4078-860a-061cae8c10ed/CleanShot%202022-06-20%20at%2011.45.28.png)
## **Deliver the best customer experience, period.**
### **Details matter. Add value with every interaction.**
Our most important core value, we only exist because of our customers.
Happy customers are paramount to growth, success, and sustainability. We care more about making more happy customers than we do about making more dollars.

The small details matter with every interaction with our customers. Perception and brand are largely built on details; it's the difference between good, great, and exceptional. There's an opportunity to add value with every interaction and it creates the perception of our product and brand experience.

Empower ourselves to fix problems and say yes, with collective customer interest in mind. This value applies internally as well when working cross-functionally with other teams!

* * *

![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/ed9f2ec8-efe7-417e-b6d4-8630f4e131a2/CleanShot%202022-02-04%20at%2016.25.14.png)
## **Normal f\*cking sucks.**
### Challenge the status quo.
Normal companies don't make history and leave a lasting, positive impact on the world. Normal is never what we should strive for or use to define us, our work, or our reasoning. This can be thought of in 2 sections:

1. **Competitors**
    *   What our competitors are doing is normal. We have to at least meet what they're doing and in most cases, we should exceed it.
2. **Our experiences**
    *   Regardless of whether we come from different companies or are experienced with ClickUp, we should challenge our Status quo. Ask yourself if you're doing things the most optimal way? Or is there a better way? Be open to challenging what you know to be normal.

We're built upon the principle of doing things differently by people that don't subscribe to the status quo or settle for good enough. Be proactive and think outside of the box in getting ahead of challenges and don't be afraid of change.

* * *

![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/4c40d90f-a1bd-44a2-90d0-645a48d9f6dd/CleanShot%202022-02-04%20at%2016.24.04.png)
## **Grow 1% every day.**
### Iterate and make progress towards perfection. Growth mindset.
Every single person at ClickUp is screened for growth mindset. Growth leads to fulfillment, happiness, and success.

We can't do it all at once, but we can change things in small increments. Iteration really matters in growth, through experimenting and testing. The reality is that things change often and it's much better to iterate in small cycles and not over-index on long, drawn-out projects.

Growth happens with **progress towards perfection**. We hold ourselves back by trying to get it perfect when the fastest growth is incremental. We are not afraid to fail lightly, as long as we learn and don't repeat the same mistakes.

We do believe that perfection is possible. Even if it doesn't feel like perfection is attainable, we should still believe it; but we won't get there overnight.

* * *

![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/2f938399-1097-4596-9ca6-760d028ca71a/CleanShot%202022-02-04%20at%2016.25.56.png)
## **No politics.**
### Be Direct. Go Direct.
There's a balance between challenging directly and caring personally. Be open with context and direct with your opinions, without being a jerk.

Don't manage up - say what you need to who you need; this helps us avoid a 'political work environment' where too much friction is created to get anything done. You're empowered to go directly to who you need and not go behind people's backs or talk to their managers—it's inefficient and creates a toxic culture.

Do what's best for the company; not what's best for yourself. We're ONE team.

Be direct and go direct. Say what you feel, be positive, optimistic, and assume good intent.

Context is important. Negative perception typically comes from missing the context behind a decision. Always assume, that if you have a negative opinion on something that happened, you're missing context. As we grow, there's so much context that isn't shared. If you're missing something, go to that person and ask for more context.

Transparency ultimately leads to efficiency, and our product enables ultimate transparency.

* * *

## **Get shit done, and have fun.**
### Work hard on the right things with urgency.
With big goals comes hard work, but time is too precious not to have fun along the way. We're a crew striving for greatness, transparency, respect; we aim to create a safe space to truly show up and be vulnerable, be bold, be daring, agree, disagree, laugh, cry, experiment, and play.

Not everything is urgent. If everything is urgent, then nothing is urgent. Consider our work with "qualified urgency" since everything we do should roll-up to our strategy.

Everyone is responsible for creating a great culture at ClickUp. We're all in this together. While not every minute of work can be gleeful, we should generally enjoy what we do and have fun with the people we work with.

* * *

## **Random acts of kindness.**
### Be net positive.
A successful company creates value and, from that value, has the opportunity to give back to the world. A meaningful portion of that value we create is distributed to causes that benefit random parties going through adversity. We ensure that our crew and their families that are experiencing rough times are taken care of through internal acts of kindness.

Don't do it for the label or the recognition, do it for what happens after the action. What's the ripple effect and is there actually something positive being done? We can own this as a company and as individuals. Are we being net positive in our daily lives in and outside of work?

# AURA/UPWARD: SUAPS Research Governance and Integration Framework

Use this page to group resources related to AURA/UPWARD program.

# AURA/UPWARD Definition

**Document Purpose**
This document defines what AURA and UPWARD are, how they operate, and how they support the broader SUAPS mission, including their connection to [SUAPS Research Lifecycle Baseline (SRLB)](https://app.clickup.com/90151026989/v/dc/2kypq09d-1355). It is intended for internal leadership, external collaborators, and prospective donors seeking clarity on the Society’s research framework.
* * *

**I. WHAT IS AURA/UPWARD?**
AURA/UPWARD is the Society for UAP Studies’ dual-track research system. It guides the full lifecycle of SUAPS-affiliated research; from project review and selection (AURA) to long-term synthesis and integration (UPWARD). This system ensures all research is rigorous, cumulative, and aligned with SUAPS’s mission to build trustworthy, interdisciplinary knowledge about UAP.

**AURA (Accelerated UAP Research & Analysis)**
*   Evaluates and oversees structured research projects.
*   Serves as SUAPS’s operational and governance engine.
*   Focuses on research design, execution, and accountability.
**UPWARD (Unified Program for Weaving Anomaly Research & Discovery)**
*   Synthesizes insights across disciplines and studies.
*   Ensures learning and coherence across the research ecosystem.
*   Frames findings within broader philosophical and epistemic contexts.
* * *

**II. WHAT THEY DO**
**AURA Responsibilities:**
*   Issues structured calls for proposals.
*   Applies review criteria (alignment, feasibility, rigor).
*   Assigns phases and Research Readiness Levels (RRLs).
*   Oversees ethics, performance benchmarks, and governance.
*   Supports logistics and project planning.
*   Follows a 7-phase lifecycle framework (adapted from ECSS):
    *   Phase 0: Needs Identification
    *   Phase 1: Feasibility & Preliminary Definition
    *   Phase 2: Detailed Definition & Funding Alignment
    *   Phase 3: Pre-Execution (logistics)
    *   Phase 4: Research Execution
    *   Phase 5: Analysis & Publication
    *   Phase 6: Integration & Closeout
**UPWARD Responsibilities:**
*   Connects findings across projects and disciplines.
*   Produces thematic syntheses, white papers, and insights.
*   Maintains the Institutional Knowledge Map (IKM).
*   Aligns outputs with strategic focus areas (e.g., aviation safety, phenomenology).
*   Informs editorial strategy and public interpretation, including _Limina_.
* * *

**III. RELATION TO PHASE 0: THE RESEARCH ONRAMP**
Phase 0 is where early ideas take root—open-ended, curiosity-driven, and donor-independent. Once a concept reaches maturity, it may transition to AURA for formal review and structured support.
**Key Distinction:**
*   Phase 0: Exploratory and generative
*   AURA: Selective and operational
*   UPWARD: Integrative and institutional
* * *

**IV. WHY AURA/UPWARD MATTERS**
**Purpose:**
*   Prevent loss or fragmentation of credible findings.
*   Ensure integrity in research operations and transparency for donors.
*   Translate findings into a lasting institutional knowledge base.

# Framing the Future of UAP Research

To be used as the main source for our pitches, internally, media, public and donors.

Every disciplined search for knowledge reaches a turning point: a moment when scattered curiosity evolves into structured inquiry. A moment when passion meets process, and discovery becomes replicable, fundable, and shareable.
For UAP research, that turning point is now.
This pitch outlines a new institutional model developed by the Society for UAP Studies. Structured in three parts, it tells a story of transformation:
*   **Before** — The inherited challenges of UAP research
*   **Breakthrough** — The system SUAPS has designed to address them
*   **After** — What becomes possible when research is governed, integrated, and shared
* * *
## **BEFORE — The Inherited Landscape of UAP Research**
UAP research has long been rich in curiosity but constrained by fragmentation and amateurism. It had passion, but no reliable infrastructure. It had data, but little continuity and no integration. For decades, inquiry into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena unfolded in an ecosystem shaped by opacity, stigma, marginalization, institutional silence and speculation.

#### 1\. A Fragmented Knowledge Environment
UAP research has lacked a unifying methodology. Military reports, private investigations, academic theories, and experiencer data rarely intersect. The result: disconnected case studies, unverified claims, and research duplication. Each new project begins as if from scratch.
There is no standard by which research is evaluated. Findings go unvalidated, unshared, or unused. No shared lifecycle exists for evaluation, funding, or publication.
#### 2\. Institutional Invisibility and Risk
Within the academy, UAP research has long been marginalized. Not because it lacks substance, but because it lacks structure. Scholars risk professional credibility by engaging publicly. Grants are rare. Journals skeptical. Without a framework, even credible researchers struggle to justify or sustain their work.
Donors face similar uncertainty: how do you fund research on UAP when there’s no way to vet proposals or track their impact?
#### 3\. Overclassification and Opacity
Governmental bodies—especially in defense and intelligence—have historically shielded UAP data under layers of secrecy. While some disclosures have been made in recent years, this legacy of overclassification has stifled open science and fueled public mistrust, conspiratorial thinking and wild speculation. Even now, most credible researchers lack access to raw data or the institutional support to analyze it.
#### 4\. Technological and Epistemic Gaps
Even when anomalies are observed, we often lack the tools to study them. Sensors are insufficient or uncalibrated. Data is incomplete or unavailable. Patterns are recognized but rarely explained. Without continuity or coordination, potential breakthroughs dissolve into isolated efforts.

## **BREAKTHROUGH — The Architecture We Built**
To address these challenges, the [_Society for UAP Studies_](http://www.societyforuapstudies.org) has developed what has never been attempted systematically and institutionally before, a:
*       *   Complete, end-to-end research governance system;
    *   Framework that does not just fund research, but transforms it into institutional knowledge;
    *   System that knows how to evaluate an idea, how to support a project, and how to carry forward insight beyond the final report.
### We call it **_AURA/UPWARD_****.**
#### 🌌 AURA: The Execution Engine
**AURA** (Accelerated UAP Research & Analysis) is SUAPS’s core research governance framework. It provides the structure for how anomaly research is selected, reviewed, supported, and delivered.
*   7 lifecycle phases: from concept intake to integration
*   Research Readiness Levels (RRL): from exploratory to implementation-ready
*   Milestone-based governance and documentation
*   Flexible protocols adapted to project risk and scope
AURA enables responsible risk-taking. It doesn’t restrict inquiry—it scaffolds it. Every project moves through a transparent, accountable, and fit-for-purpose lifecycle.

Think of it as your research launchpad—with mission control built in.
#### 🧠 UPWARD: The Integration Layer
**UPWARD** (Unified Program for Weaving Anomaly Research & Discovery) ensures that findings are not isolated. It’s the connective tissue of the SUAPS ecosystem.
*   Builds the Institutional Knowledge Map (IKM)
*   Links insights _across_ projects and themes
*   Supports meta-analysis, theory development, and cross-disciplinary collaboration
*   Channels findings into education, citizen science, and public briefings

But UPWARD is more than a library, it’s an engine of second-order insight.
> UPWARD also supports anomaly-aligned AI tools: models that can detect patterns, support classification, and surface insights across domains. Not to replace researchers—but to amplify their capacity for discovery.

UPWARD is where SUAPS begins to **think across its own boundaries.**

And as findings begin to point toward new materials, behaviors, or applications, UPWARD also provides a bridge to responsible innovation. SUAPS welcomes entrepreneurial collaborators willing to explore, test, and potentially commercialize discoveries that emerge from structured inquiry, always with scientific integrity and public benefit as guiding values.

Together, AURA and UPWARD form a complete research architecture: execution plus integration. Governance plus meaning.

Together, AURA and UPWARD offer more than governance. They offer **the infrastructure of credibility**. They are the spine of anomaly science. They are what comes next.

## **AFTER — What This Makes Possible**

With AURA/UPWARD in place, the field of UAP research no longer has to operate in isolation or obscurity:
*   Researchers gain a trusted process with which to _develop, test, and publish serious work_;
*   Donors see exactly where their funding goes—and how it contributes;
*   Institutions throughout the research community _gain a framework for meaningful engagement_ with a historically sidelined domain.

~~AURA/UPWARD gives SUAPS the~~ ~~operational credibility of an institute~~~~, the ethical backbone of a public trust, and the agility of a discovery engine.~~

It also lays the foundation for a more expansive vision:
*   A global ecosystem of aligned researchers, working in lifecycle-aware cohorts
*   A research archive and knowledge map that grows in value year over year
*   The integration of human and machine intelligence for second-order insight
*   A model of nonprofit governance that could scale to other anomalous frontiers

And most importantly, it provides UAP research - across different fields in the natural and social sciences, and the humanities - with something it has never had: _shared scaffolding_. Continuity. A system of trust.

This is not a toolkit. This is how a field grows up and finally matures.

Let’s build it—together.

# AURA/UPWARD Strategic briefing

### To be used as the guideline of AURA page on the website
## Executive Summary
Every credible scientific discipline must eventually build structure around its inquiry. For UAP research, that time is now. For decades, research has advanced without common protocols for scoping, governance, or integration. The result: duplicated efforts, stalled discovery, and limited credibility.

To address this, the Society for UAP Studies has developed AURA/UPWARD, a two-part infrastructure designed to bring clarity and coherence to a fragmented landscape.

**AURA** (Accelerated UAP Research & Analysis) is a seven-phase execution model that guides project intake, review, milestones, and lifecycle oversight.

**UPWARD** (Unified Program for Weaving Anomaly Research & Discovery) curates knowledge across projects, generating cross-cutting insights, institutional memory, and long-range foresight.
Together, AURA and UPWARD will help convert isolated efforts into a coordinated, transparent, and fundable body of research. They offer the beginnings of a shared system for building and stewarding knowledge, a foundational shift for a field ready to mature.
* * *
## AURA: The Execution Engine
**What is AURA?**
AURA is SUAPS’s operational system for managing anomaly research from submission to closeout. It turns fragmented inquiry into a structured, trackable process, embedding accountability and scientific rigor at every phase.
### Core Features:
**Seven Lifecycle Phases**, adapted from leading Aerospace industry best practices:
*       *   Phase 0: Concept Development
    *   Phase 1: Feasibility & Scoping
    *   Phase 2: Detailed Design & Funding Alignment
    *   Phase 3: Pre-Execution Logistics
    *   Phase 4: Research Execution
    *   Phase 5: Analysis & Communication
    *   Phase 6: Closeout & Integration
**Research Readiness Levels (RRLs):**
AURA uses a 9-point scale to position each project along a maturity continuum—from exploratory to implementation-ready. This guides resourcing, review, and milestone planning.
**Milestone-Based Governance:**
*   Reviews assess not only merit but also feasibility, ethics, and contribution.
*   Each project follows a clear reporting pathway, with checkpoints and deliverables.
**Flexible by Design:**
*   Supports a wide range of research, including field reports, signal analysis, and philosophy of science.
*   Speculative or early-stage inquiries receive structured oversight to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
**Sidebar: How AURA Works**
*   Submit via Phase 0 intake or formal RFP
*   Evaluate using SUAPS criteria and RRL scale
*   Assign to lifecycle phase and governance track
*   Monitor through embedded milestones
*   Feed findings into the UPWARD system

AURA ensures every project entering the SUAPS ecosystem strengthens a growing body of credible, replicable, and ethically guided UAP knowledge.

### UPWARD: The Integration Layer
**What is UPWARD?**
UPWARD is SUAPS’s metascientific infrastructure—the system that ensures research findings aren’t just completed, but connected. It integrates outputs from AURA and affiliated research into a shared framework for building cumulative insight.

**Core Functions**
**Institutional Knowledge Map (IKM):**
*   A living, visual map of all SUAPS-affiliated research
*   Shows relationships between projects, domains, and emerging hypotheses
**Cross-Project Synthesis:**
*   Curates research into thematic white papers, comparative models, and meta-analyses
*   Identifies recurring patterns, gaps, and signals across disciplines
**Public & Policy Translation:**
*   Produces accessible briefings, learning tools, and citizen-science prompts
*   Builds transparency, public understanding, and institutional trust
**AI-Augmented Insight:**
*   Hosts machine learning tools for pattern recognition, classification, and signal matching
*   Supports human interpretation with ethical guardrails and reproducibility checks
**Sidebar: UPWARD in Action**
*   A field report from Italy is linked to Canadian sensor data through the IKM
*   Two AURA projects on aerial clustering inform a shared white paper
*   A classification model is trained on data from 14 prior studies
*   An open-access dashboard shows how research aligns with safety and information theory

UPWARD transforms raw findings into a navigable system of knowledge. It ensures that anomaly science becomes cumulative, coherent, and visibly relevant to institutions and the public alike.

Together, AURA and UPWARD provide not just governance, but meaningful infrastructure, a coordinated foundation for turning inquiry into enduring knowledge.

## AFTER: What This Makes Possible
The introduction of AURA/UPWARD marks a step-change in the credibility, continuity, and collaborative potential of UAP research.
Where projects were once isolated, they now interlock. Where funders once lacked transparency, they now gain visibility. Where insights once dissipated, they now compound.
### With AURA/UPWARD, we enable:
*   **Lifecycle-Aware Research Cohorts**
    *   Researchers can join a structured network with a shared governance model, reducing duplication and enabling collaboration.
*   **Growing Knowledge Commons**
    *   Each project enriches an institutional archive, deepening the field’s capacity to identify trends, compare results, and refine questions.
*   **Funding Confidence**
    *   Donors can assess maturity, impact, and risk across proposals using a standardized lens.
*   **Cross-Sector Credibility**
    *   Government partners, universities, and civil institutions can engage anomaly science through a professionalized, transparent channel.
*   **Entrepreneurial Translation**
    *   Insights from UPWARD may seed opportunities for open innovation, responsible prototyping, or anomaly-aligned ventures.
*   **Human–Machine Co-Discovery**
    *   Researchers working alongside ethical AI models can surface patterns, connect data types, and unlock second-order insights.
### In summary:
AURA builds the structure. UPWARD ensures the meaning. Together, they give the field its first shared spine.
This is not the end of inquiry. It’s how sustainable science begins.

# AI in UPWARD

UPWARD is uniquely positioned to host **anomaly-focused AI innovation,** not just for data automation, but for higher-order insight.
Here’s how:
 AI as a Synthesis Tool
UPWARD can coordinate the development of **cross-project AI models** that detect patterns, propose taxonomies, and flag correlations across large UAP datasets.
 Ethical AI Infrastructure
Position SUAPS as a **leader in ethical anomaly-AI** by ensuring all models are transparent, interpretable, and anchored in expert-reviewed data—avoiding overfitting, bias, or speculative amplification.
 AI Integration Track
Establish an internal UPWARD-AI track, with projects such as:
*   NLP models to extract themes across case reports or sensor logs
*   Ontology engines for mapping UAP-related concepts
*   Anomaly clustering algorithms for correlating cases by shape, behavior, or telemetry
> Just as UPWARD integrates across disciplines, it should integrate across _intelligences_—human and artificial.

**1) Why I Don’t Think AURA Is Reinventing the Wheel**
Since you raised the “why new labels?” question, I thought it might help to show what I’m actually comparing AURA to behind the scenes.
Here’s how I see it:
*   **NASA (ROSES):** One proposal = two formal stages (Step-1 + Step-2), multiple SF-424 forms, NASA-only supplements, and a 74-page guide just to tell you what goes where.
*   **NSF (Convergence Research):** It’s not just the 15-page description—you need a Convergence Management Plan, collaboration letters, personnel tables, full budgets across five years, etc.
*   **AURA (SUAPS):** Seven phases, a 9-point Research Readiness Level (RRL) scale, and milestone check-ins. It's prescriptive where it needs to be (rigor), but we explicitly allow merging or skipping phases for smaller efforts.

To me, the overall effort is in the same ballpark. The big difference is structure: NASA and NSF front-load everything into one massive grant submission. AURA spreads the lift across project phases, which I think lowers the initial barrier and helps us course-correct midstream.
* * *
**Here’s What I Think Matters**
*   **It’s not a new idea.** Phase-gate models are used in over 75% of top U.S. companies. We didn’t invent it, we just adapted it to a research context where project management is (or should be) already part of our toolset.
*   **Same effort, better pacing.** This isn’t about adding paperwork. It’s about not asking for everything up front. Instead of making people deliver 100% of their vision in one go, we ask for the right pieces at the right moments. To me, that’s just respectful of researchers’ time and brainspace.
*   **Tailored, not one-size-fits-all.** $5K pilot? Archival project? Great. You can merge phases and move on—just document why. There’s no bureaucratic overhead for its own sake.
*   **Only 3 of 7 phases require narratives.** The rest are check-ins, and they’re short. Ironically, NASA’s two-step process demands more narrative work than this.
* * *
**Why Engineering Matters Here**
One of the issues I keep seeing in UAP work is the data reproducibility gap. But actual systems that capture the data are reproducible and that's where engineers thrive. [NASA’s own 2023 report says it clearly](https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/uap-independent-study-team-final-report.pdf): the biggest problem is that UAP observations aren’t consistently calibrated or documented. It’s a metadata issue, a sensor design issue, a classic engineering issue.
That same report (and things like the [Galileo Observatory](https://thedebrief.org/galileo-project-releases-commissioning-data-on-half-a-million-aerial-objects-are-any-of-them-uap/)) points toward solutions that come right out of engineering playbooks: sensor arrays, calibration protocols, AI pipelines. This isn’t new thinking, it’s just something UAP studies need more of.
That’s why I think it’s important we have a framework that doesn’t just invite engineers it signals from the start that their skills are essential.
* * *
**So, in my view:**
*   AURA is just solid project management, adapted for a new field.
*   It doesn’t ask for more than existing frameworks, just spaces it differently.
*   And yeah, maybe it feels like something “new” in tone or branding and that's precisely the purpose. I think we need a new factor if we want this work to be taken seriously and reach beyond the usual circles.

**2) why I'm confident enough to affirm that UAP is indeed exceptional.**
Let me start with something we actually agree on: UAP work shouldn’t isolate itself from the broader research ecosystem. We’ve been stuck in that loop for decades, and I’d argue that could part of the problem. But to me, this isn’t about claiming UAP is “special” in a way that makes it seem superior. It’s about facing the very real structural and cultural differences that shape how this work unfolds.
* * *
**Why I** **_do_** **think UAP research is different**
**a) The stigma is real and way heavier than in comparable fields.**
This isn’t a rhetorical point. [NASA’s own UAP report](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/uap-independent-study-team-final-report-0.pdf?emrc=68868fbeb6f76) explicitly lists stigma as a major barrier to reporting. A 2024 [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03351-4.pdf) [survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03351-4.pdf) found that **69% of faculty worry about ridicule** if they pursue this topic. The [1953 Robertson Panel](https://www.nicap.org/reports/1953_robertson_panel.htm) even recommended an explicit “debunking” campaign. That’s more than just discomfort, it’s career risk.
Compare that to planetary defense. Sure, there were skeptics in the '80s who called asteroid research alarmist, but the argument was about cost and not whether you were crazy. By 1992, Congress ordered the [Spaceguard Survey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2025/06/30/in-honor-of-world-asteroid-day-a-short-history-of-planetary-defense/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to go ahead. Meanwhile, in the same era, anyone talking seriously about UFOs was dismissed, ridiculed or worse. Bob Lazar in very same 80's (which I think we all know the story about how his career and personal life were completely destroyed) is an extreme example, but the fact that his story, once completely ridiculed, is now aligned with topics under discussion in U.S. congressional hearings shows how distorted the landscape has been.
And beyond stigma: we’re not just dealing with odd sightings. Witnesses talk about instant acceleration, sensor gaps, biological effects, even “transforming” phenomena, shapeshifting or telepathy. You don’t have to believe all of it to recognize that this domain touches edges of our knowledge in ways most fields simply don’t.

**b) UAP really does span more disciplines.**
Not because we’re smarter or more complex, but because we _have_ to. Here’s a rough side-by-side comparing the disciplines involved in three different research domains, based on current programs and documents:

| Discipline Cluster | UAP Programs¹ | Planetary Defense² | Astrobiology³ |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Physical sciences | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| Engineering/sensors | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| Aviation/human factors | ✔︎ | ✖︎ | ✖︎ |
| Intelligence/national security | ✔︎ | ✖︎ | ✖︎ |
| Data science / AI | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| Social & behavioral science | ✔︎ | ✖︎ | ✖︎ |
| Ethics/policy | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| Science communication | ✔︎ | ✖︎ | ✖︎ |

The reason we draw in so many domains is structural:
*   **Safety:** UAPs show up in controlled airspace. Pilots, regulators, and accident investigators must be at the table.
*   **Security:** The difference between a Chinese drone and a non-terrestrial object is not a metaphysical question—it’s a threat-detection one.
*   **Human data chain:** Eyewitness accounts, cultural filters, stigma effects and none of this is optional background noise. It _is_ the data pipeline.
*   **Public comms:** NASA literally put science journalists on its UAP panel to handle misinformation risk.

To me, these aren’t optional layers, they’re baked into how UAP work must function if we want it to be rigorous.
Bottom line, I agree there’s a real risk of self-censorship and isolation from other disciplines if we lean too hard into the idea that UAP is uniquely complex. But if we do this right—and I believe AURA can help—we shift the perception from self-importance to something more grounded: **common-sense risk management**, which is a core concern in project management.
* * *
**3) But that’s not the reason** **_why_** **I believe something like AURA is needed.**
We don't even have a real “UAP field” yet. If it exists, it’s still in pre-formation. We've had 70+ years of sightings, reports, and debate and almost nothing came out of it . You said it yourself: we still don’t have critical mass in the scholarly world. We’re starving for engagement. And I agree. Yes, stigma is softening. But **69% of faculty still think this field is nonsense**. That’s not progress. That’s inertia.
**What we need now is a forcing function, a catalyst to sparkle action among academics and enthusiasts.**
Something to push the field out of its ambiguous status. Something simple, credible, and accessible, while still being serious enough to anchor high-integrity work.
That’s where I see AURA fitting in.

From an engineering standpoint, AURA is not just a framework, it’s a scaffold. A place to hang the field’s structure while it takes shape. It’s clear, lightweight, and built on concepts we already use in research and business. You can merge phases. You can skip steps. But it gives us a common language, a shared rhythm.
From a business side, I see AURA as a way to **actually activate public support and big donors engagement**. We keep talking about how we need new funding but who’s mobilizing that? If we build AURA the right way, I think we can let the public fund this work directly, without waiting for federal or philanthropic saviors.
We _are_ planning to "sell" AURA, and the scholars as a product, but not just any product. It’s more like a foundation, a shared platform that could unlock:
*   More grant money
*   Better proposal quality
*   Better sensors, metadata, and reproducibility
*   More interdisciplinary teams who can work together without reinventing the wheel

None of that happens by itself. We need buy-in. And yes, some good storytelling (an idea is just as good as your ability to sell it). But that’s part of the job. We’re trying to anchor a field. And that means giving people something to hold onto.

**What Is AURA + SUAPS Trying to Be?**
My goal is to make AURA the most effective public–private initiative for UAP studies ever attempted. That means:
*   Getting real funding to projects that would otherwise fall through the cracks
*   Making sure UAP studies are approached seriously and responsibly
*   Serving as a catalyst for actual _action_ in the field
*   Reducing stigma by making project structures transparent and understandable
*   Attracting both donors and the broader public by offering a clear, trustworthy framework—with real projects, ready to go

**“If we’re scaling down, why add new terms and new phases?”**
My answer is simple: because the data says it works better.
It may seem like external gates or extra stages could slow things down, but the opposite is what actually happens. Organizations that rigorously phase-gate their work [_double their project success rate_](https://www.stage-gate.com/blog/the-stage-gate-model-an-overview/) [and reach delivery 2–3 times faster](https://www.stage-gate.com/blog/the-stage-gate-model-an-overview/). That’s not my opinion, it’s what the benchmark data shows. Over 80% of top-performing North American firms use some version of Stage-Gate project design.
A 2022 study in _Procedia Computer Science_ found R&I projects using PM finished [**15–20% faster**](https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/bitstream/10198/27937/1/JRA%20_framework_Santos_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) than ad-hoc teams and A cross-disciplinary lab survey showed that [**clear scopes, timelines, and defined roles**](https://www.academia.edu/21172876/Project_management_for_academic_research_projects_balancing_structure_and_flexibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com) correlated with more publications and better grant success.

* * *

**About those “gates” and scale rules**
Totally fair point: they’re not yet fully published. We _do_ have a working document that lays out the lifecycle model behind AURA. It defines the seven phases, what the reviews look like, and how scale changes the depth required at each gate.
I hadn’t shared it before because it’s still a work-in-progress and it’s a bit outdated. But I’m happy to share it now, because I really value your critique and think it can help us refine it.
Our goal is not to create a bureaucratic maze. It’s to create just enough structure to make success more likely, and to make the field legible and fundable without draining people with unnecessary admin.

# Reply 2

You raise a vital point: are we importing unnecessary bureaucracy, or delivering real support to scholars? My view is this: **we’re not bringing in corporate oversight. we’re importing a tested coordination toolkit that helps researchers spend more time doing science and less time firefighting.**
* * *
### 1\. First, the web hiccups
You’re right. Key content was hidden behind hover states and a shared modal, making it harder than it should be to engage with the details. That’s now a priority fix. We’ve launched a biweekly UX sprint cycle to tackle those flaws.
* * *
### 2\. Are we multiplying forms and adding more hoops?
AURA’s lifecycle may look more intricate than a traditional “proposal → award → report” loop. Seven phases, gates like SRR and CDR, and language drawn from NASA’s mission handbook. It may feel like project micromanagement.
But the core mechanics are familiar to anyone who’s written a NASA ROSES or NSF grant:
*   **Phase 0** is a concept note—like ROSES Step-1.
*   **Phases 1 & 2** are the full proposal package: narrative, budget, data plan, bios. If the project is small, they can be merged into one PDF.
*   **Gates like SRR, CDR, and VRR** aren’t new submissions. They’re updates to a single living document. Think “track changes,” not fresh forms.
*   **Reporting in Phases 5–6** mirrors NSF RPPR and NASA performance formats.

So the perceived complexity is mostly in labels and not in added work.
* * *
### 3\. Why UAP needs a tailored framework
Planetary defense is a fair comparison but UAP studies face additional constraints:

| Dimension | Planetary Defense | UAP Studies |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Data access | Public telescope archives | Classified, fragmented, or restricted records |
| Public perception | NASA-backed, stigma-free | Lingering “UFO” baggage |
| Method mix | Mainly STEM | Physics, psychology, linguistics, geopolitics, religion |

This fusion of technical and human dimensions means most existing review panels aren’t set up to evaluate UAP proposals on their own terms. AURA’s phase map and readiness levels can be a scaffold, a way for physicists, psychologists, and anthropologists to speak the same language from day one.

### 4\. Project Management isn’t new and it’s already behind science’s biggest wins
What some interpret as “corporate” gatekeeping is actually the distilled version of how big science runs:

| Flagship project | PM in use | Why it matters |
| ---| ---| --- |
| NASA missions | SRR → CDR → VRR | [Keeps $2B observatories on schedule](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733321002407?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| CERN upgrades | WBS, earned-value tracking | [260+ physicists, coordinated around shared goals](https://project-management.web.cern.ch/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Academic publishing teams | Formal PM increases on-time delivery | [Higher satisfaction, fewer deadline misses](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-77806-3_14?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

We’re not inventing oversight. We’re scaling down what works for $2B science so it fits $5K–$5M UAP research.
And it works:
*   A 2022 study in _Procedia Computer Science_ found R&I projects using PM finished [**15–20% faster**](https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/bitstream/10198/27937/1/JRA%20_framework_Santos_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) than ad-hoc teams.
*   A cross-disciplinary lab survey showed that [**clear scopes, timelines, and defined roles**](https://www.academia.edu/21172876/Project_management_for_academic_research_projects_balancing_structure_and_flexibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com) correlated with more publications and better grant success.
* * *
### 5\. Why PM often feels like micromanagement—until it doesn’t

| Initial worry | Reality with AURA |
| ---| --- |
| “Extra paperwork” | One living doc replaces 10 stray decks |
| “Loss of autonomy” | Scope locks donors out of PI decisions |
| “Engineering jargon” | matching language SRR → “Scope Check” |

* * *
### 6\. Why not just use [Experiment.com](http://experiment.com/)?
Experiment is a great micro-grant platform, and we may syndicate certain Phase 0 pilots there. But it’s not enough on its own. Here’s why:
*   **Domain focus:** AURA is being built for UAP studies, with field-specific reviewers and readiness levels.
*   **Full lifecycle support:** Experiment stops at fundraising. AURA supports concept vetting, logistics, design review, compliance, and synthesis.
*   **Scale:** Most Experiment projects raise $2K–$15K; AURA aims to $250K+ builds like the Baltic Sea Anomaly project.
*   **Sensitive content:** Experiment requires public posting. AURA can handle NDA-limited or ITAR-adjacent work.
*   **Funding diversity:** AURA supports private donors _and_ NSF/NASA subawards. Experiment handles only micro-philanthropy.
_Experiment is a great tool for public-facing seed tests, but it can’t anchor a field_. AURA can. Where visibility helps, we’ll cross-list.
* * *
### 7\. How AURA actually helps a UAP PI
*   **Time-saver:** Our Phase 2 maps directly to NSF’s 15-page format, ready to submit with light edits.
*   **Tailored load:** $10K pilots can skip multiple gates; six-figure projects get right-sized oversight.
*   **Reusable data:** PM requires file formats and metadata up front, so nothing gets lost in translation. Data drops into UPWARD, not onto forgotten drives.
* * *
### 8\. Why we are not limiting AURA to private donors and how AURA can actually a catalyst for increase in federal investment
We are pursuing multiple parallel funding lanes:
*   **Grass-roots supporters:** monthly contributors.
*   **Major philanthropy and private donations:** accelerates key portfolios (e.g., sensor networks).
*   **Traditional grants.** AURA’s documentation matches into NSF and NASA proposal formats, allowing SUAPS to lead or coordinate multi-institution bids.

Of the $186B U.S. federal R&D spend in FY23, almost none was earmarked for UAP studies. Here are some reasons we could come up why is that and how AURA can support:
*   **The “program-code vacuum.”**
Most agencies don’t have a dedicated UAP line item, so proposals fall between disciplinary stools. AURA can fix this by tagging every Phase 0 idea to at least one recognized NSF or NASA program element, like Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences or Human Factors. This ensures reviewers see the project as “within scope,” not an orphan looking for a home.
*   **Sparse or fragmented data.**
Many UAP studies stall for lack of preliminary evidence. AURA can issues micro-grants to fund early sensor campaigns and deposits the results—raw and metadata—in our UPWARD repository. That way, PIs have citable data from the start, without having to recreate the wheel.
*   **Stigma and policy risk.**
Review panels often worry about reputational blowback or sensational headlines. Every AURA-backed proposal can carry a visible endorsement of our Advisory board, plus a two-page public-interest and ethics memo. This helps panels focus on the science, not the surrounding noise.
*   **Administrative non-compliance.**
Sometimes good proposals are rejected before they’re even reviewed: wrong font, missing table, wrong page count. AURA can run every outgoing proposal through a compliance check to ensure they pass the NSF/NIH format gates on first try.
*   **Reviewer unfamiliarity with mixed methods.**
UAP work spans physics, cognitive science, anthropology, aerospace, philosophy and much more. Many reviewers are only fluent in one of those. AURA can provide templates translate technical gate names into plain academic language. This lowers cognitive load and keeps mixed-discipline panels aligned.
*   **Low proposal pressure.**
Funding follows volume. If only a few scholars submit UAP proposals, agencies assume the topic lacks depth. AURA can host periodic matchmaking sessions, helping teams cohere in time to batch-submit around federal deadlines. More quality submissions lead to more awards, even at steady success rates.
*   **Export-control and ITAR concerns.**
Some UAP projects touch on sensitive sensors or military data. AURA can include a security advisory cell that flags potential ITAR issues early and helps PIs shape compliant release plans. This gives panels a clear path forward rather than an undefined red flag.
* * *
Each of these mechanisms serves a single goal: make it easier for scholars to propose UAP research that meets federal expectations—without diluting its ambition.
* * *
### 9\. The frame to share with colleagues
Think of AURA as a lit on-ramp to the same highway NSF and NASA already drive. We’re not creating bureaucracy, we’re replacing email-chains and ambiguity with tools that scale. And those tools aren’t handcuffs, they’re exoskeletons. They bear the weight of coordination so researchers can reach further.

The goal isn’t to control science, it’s to help scholars survive the early phases where UAP research too often disappears: misrouted, under-scoped, or never submitted at all.

Thanks again for holding us to a high bar.

# AURA FAQ

### 1 · Big-picture

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **What is AURA in one sentence?** | AURA is a phase-gate project-management scaffold—adapted from NASA/ESA best practice—for any UAP-related study from ≈ US $5 k pilots to ≈ US $5 m multi-sensor builds. |
| **Why does SUAPS think UAP research needs its own framework?** | Because no mature, discipline-wide norms exist yet: data are often uncalibrated, stigma discourages reporting, and proposals fall between traditional NSF/NASA program lines. AURA supplies a shared language, lightweight gates, and templates that make projects fundable and reproducible without reinventing the wheel. |
| **Isn’t this just adding bureaucracy?** | AURA spreads the same total effort most funders demand over 7 logical checkpoints instead of one giant grant packet. Only **3 of the 7 phases** require narrative writing; the others are short milestone check-ins or live reviews. Small studies can merge or skip phases. |

* * *
### 2 · Structure & terminology

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **How many phases are there and what do they map to?** | **7 phases**<br>0 Concept → 1 Definition → 2 Detailed Design → 3 Execution Prep → 4 Execution → 5 Synthesis → 6 Integration.<br>Each header also shows its NASA/NSF “equivalent” (e.g., _Phase 2 / PDR-equivalent_). |
| **What is the Research Readiness Level (RRL)?** | A nine-point maturity scale, mirroring NASA’s TRL, but tuned for research questions instead of hardware. RRL 1 = curiosity / hypothesis; RRL 9 = data archived, paper accepted. |
| **Can I merge phases for a US $10 k archival study?** | Yes. Projects under US $10 k or < 90 days may merge 0-1-2 into a single “Concept+Plan” PDF. You just document the merge in the cover sheet. |
| **Who runs the gate reviews—SUAPS or my own team?** | Your team leads the science; SUAPS chairs the gate, mainly to check scope, ethics, and data-management compliance. Think “external peer assist,” not “command-and-control.” |

* * *
### 3 · Scope of support

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **Is AURA only for new or non-academic PIs?** | No. It’s designed for mixed teams—tenured faculty, engineers, pilots, citizen-scientists—because _everyone_ in UAP work is effectively a beginner in a still-forming field. |
| **What concrete help do I get?** | • Editable proposal & budget templates (NASA/NSF compatible)<br>• A “Rosetta Stone” table mapping AURA phases to ROSES & NSF sections<br>• Bi-weekly live clinics on gate prep<br>• Automatic compliance checks (fonts, page limits, ITAR flags)<br>• Central data-repository (UPWARD) with DOI minting |
| **Does AURA fund projects itself?** | Yes—via four lanes: micro-grants from public donors, major-gift underwriting, and crowdfunding partnership bids routed into NSF/NASA calls. |

* * *
### 4 · Interdisciplinarity & engineering

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **Why does AURA lean on corporate project-management and engineering language—shouldn’t we stick to traditional academic terminology?** | AURA isn’t replacing scholarly vocabulary; it adds a cross-sector dialect that lets physicists, data-scientists, pilots, and funding partners stay on the same page. Sensor calibration, metadata standards, earned-value checkpoints—the “engineering/corporate” terms you see are the shortest, most widely recognised labels for those concepts. Using them up-front:<br>forces clarity on reproducibility (a NASA-identified gap in UAP work),<br>lets mixed teams plug directly into proven phase-gate workflows, and<br>reassures donors and industry partners that the project is managed with the same discipline they trust on billion-dollar missions.<br>Scientists still set the hypotheses and lead the analysis; the shared language just keeps everyone—academic or not—marching in step. |
| **Is UAP work really more interdisciplinary than asteroid defence or exoplanets?** | Typically, yes. UAP study adds aviation-safety, intelligence analysis, social-psychology, and crisis-communications layers on top of the usual physics / astronomy / engineering stack. NASA’s 2023 UAP panel itself included pilots, journalists, policy experts and oceanographers. |
| **Where do humanities or policy-only studies fit?** | They run the same phases, but the “Sensor & Metadata Plan” becomes a **“Source & Method Plan.”** Small, qualitative projects may merge Phases 0-1-2 and skip hardware-specific checklist items. |
| **How is AURA governed?** | An independent advisory board (scientists, engineers, ethicists, community reps) approves any framework changes. Meeting minutes are published **quarterly** for transparency |

* * *
### 5 · Stigma & “exceptionalism”

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **Are we claiming UAP is uniquely special?** | No—just that it operates under heavier stigma and data fragmentation than most domains. 69 % of faculty (Nature, 2024) fear ridicule; classified data add another barrier. AURA helps normalise the work by making processes transparent and comparable to mainstream science. |
| **Does talking about telepathy or shapeshifting in reports hurt credibility?** | Extreme claims are logged in a _Human-Effects Annex_ so they don’t contaminate flight-safety or sensor data. AURA prioritises verifiable, multi-sensor observations; anecdotal “high-strangeness” is treated as sociological context, not core evidence. |

* * *
### 6 · Workload & speed

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **Won’t seven gates slow my timeline?** | Benchmarks say the opposite: phase-gated R&D doubles success rates and can reduce cycle time 2-3× because flaws surface early. A small UAP pilot can move from Phase 0 to funded in **≈ 45 days** versus the 9-month federal-call cycle. |
| **What if I already use Agile, Scrum, or CERN-style EVMS?** | Great—attach your existing artifacts to AURA’s checkpoints. The framework is format-agnostic as long as the information content (scope, risk, budget, data plan) is present. |

* * *
### 7 · Data & reproducibility

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ---| --- |
| **How does AURA enforce data quality?** | At Phase 2 you submit a Sensor & Metadata Plan; checks include calibration method, timestamp protocol, and archive format. Data must be deposited in UPWARD by Phase 6 for DOI minting and future synthesis studies. |
| **Can AURA handle ITAR-sensitive or classified inputs?** | Yes. A security-advisory cell flags red-lines early and can route gated releases or red-team reviews. Public-facing summaries are crafted to stay within disclosure limits. |

* * *
### 8 · Common objections & quick answers

| **Objection** | **Quick counter** |
| ---| --- |
| “This is corporate project management.” | It’s the same SRR-CDR-VRR spine used by NASA missions and DOE particle-physics builds—just right-sized. |
| “Extra phases = extra paperwork.” | Only three phases need writing; others are 30-min reviews inside one evolving doc. |
| “I already submit to NSF—why bother?” | AURA Phase 2 maps 1-to-1 onto NSF’s 15-page description; you get templates, compliance pre-checks, and potential bridge funding before the federal decision. |

# Policy & Procedures on Ethical and Professional Handling of UAP Experiencers and Encounter Claims [DRAFT]

## 1\. Purpose & Scope
This policy establishes ethical and professional guidelines for handling cases where individuals (hereafter "experiencers") report encounters with Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or claim contact with nonhuman entities or intelligence(s). Given the stigma and controversy surrounding such claims, SUAPS maintains strict neutrality regarding their veridicality while ensuring respectful engagement.

It must be noted that the Society does not serve as a therapeutic, investigative, or adjudicative body regarding such claims. Instead, it facilitates appropriate referrals to qualified professionals while safeguarding ethical standards in engagement.

## 2\. Core Ethical Principles
*   Neutrality & Non-Endorsement: SUAPS does not take a position on the veridicality or truthfulness of experiencer accounts. The Society engages in nonjudgmental, respectful communication while maintaining scientific and academic rigor.
*   Respect for Psychological Well-being: Independently of the validity of claims, psychological trauma may be present. SUAPS recognizes this potential and ensures that experiencers are treated with dignity and compassion.
*   Referral to Relevant Professionals: SUAPS does not provide direct counseling or validation of experiences but refers individuals to professional organizations with expertise in psychological and medical aspects of UAP-related experiences.
*   Vigilance Against Deception: While engaging respectfully, SUAPS remains aware that some claims may be fabricated, exaggerated, or made for self-promotion. Careful discretion is exercised when interacting with such cases.

## 3\. Procedures for Handling Experiencer Cases
#### 3.1 Initial Contact & Intake
*   Any individual reaching out to SUAPS regarding a personal UAP or nonhuman intelligence encounter should be treated courteously and professionally.
*   Staff, volunteers, or leadership who receive such inquiries should not offer personal interpretations, opinions, or validation of the claims.
*   The experiencer should be informed that SUAPS is not an investigative or therapeutic body but can refer them to relevant professionals.
#### 3.2 Referral Process
*   SUAPS will maintain a list of vetted organizations and professionals to whom experiencers can be referred.
*   Current recommended referral organizations include, but are not limited to:
    *   John E. Mack Institute (JEMI) – Focused on psychological and academic study of experiencer cases.
    *   UAPMed – Medical and mental health professionals engaging with UAP-related phenomena.
*   If an experiencer appears to be in acute psychological distress, they should be encouraged to seek licensed mental health professionals or crisis support services in their area.
#### 3.3 Internal Handling & Documentation
*   SUAPS does not keep records of experiencer reports beyond minimal administrative notes required for tracking referral actions.
*   All interactions should be conducted with confidentiality and discretion, ensuring the experiencer’s privacy is protected.
*   Volunteers and staff should not engage in prolonged personal correspondence regarding an experiencer’s claims. If an experiencer continues outreach beyond the referral stage, they should be reminded of SUAPS’ policy and directed to appropriate professionals.
#### 3.4 Ethical Safeguards & Avoidance of Exploitation
*   SUAPS will not use experiencer cases as publicity tools or promotional material.
*   No experiencer will be pressured to participate in research, interviews, or documentation efforts.
*   If SUAPS engages in academic research on experiencer testimony, it must adhere to institutional review board (IRB) ethical guidelines to protect participants.
## 4\. Oversight & Training
*   All SUAPS personnel handling experiencer cases will undergo training on best practices for respectful engagement, mental health awareness, and referral procedures.
*   The Society will periodically review this policy and update referral partners to ensure ethical and professional standards are upheld.

# Organizational Structure of SUAPS

The Society for UAP Studies (SUAPS) is structured to ensure efficient governance, operational stability, programmatic success, and financial sustainability. The organization is divided into four primary components:

1. **Executive Leadership** – Responsible for strategic oversight, governance, and decision-making.
2. **Advisory Council** – A nonbinding advisory body that ensures programmatic quality, strategic alignment, and institutional credibility.
3. **Operational Division** – Manages administrative, financial, and development functions.
4. **Programmatic Division** – Oversees research, education, public outreach, and content dissemination.
Each component is designed for clear role differentiation, accountability, and mission-driven growth.
## Leadership Tier Differentiation: Directors vs. Managers
SUAPS operates on a lean but scalable leadership structure that prioritizes strategic-level Director roles over Manager roles in its early-stage development. This model enables focused oversight while allowing future expansion through layered support.
### Director Roles
*   Lead strategic planning, oversight, and implementation of core programs or divisions.
*   Collaborate cross-functionally with Executive Leadership.
*   Represent SUAPS in external collaborations, institutional partnerships, or media engagement.
*   Serve as leadership anchors in areas such as Operations, Communications, Research, Education, Outreach, and Development.
### Manager/Coordinator Roles
*   Tactical or administrative support roles under Director supervision.
*   Responsible for executing defined initiatives, supporting outreach tasks, or managing operational logistics.
*   Introduced only as capacity demands increase and strategic infrastructure is well-established.
### Guiding Principle:
Directors are appointed first to establish leadership infrastructure; Managers or Coordinators are only introduced to support Directors once the programmatic scale or complexity warrants it. This model ensures role clarity, efficient communication flow, and avoids redundancy across divisions.

# Executive Leadership (Governance & Strategic Oversight)

The Executive Leadership Team provides high-level decision-making, operational guidance, and strategic vision for SUAPS.

## **Board of Directors**

# Initial Collaborative Project Brief

### Advisory Council's Development of SUAPS' Institutional Ethical Frameworks
* * *
## 🎯 Purpose
As part of your onboarding to the Advisory Council of the Society for UAP Studies (SUAPS), we invite you to join our first shared strategic initiative: the development of institutional ethical frameworks for the Society. This effort will serve both as a team-building activity and as a foundational contribution to SUAPS’ long-term identity, research posture, and professional legitimacy.
* * *
## 🧱 Background
SUAPS is committed to scientific and academic integrity in the emergent field of UAP Studies. As such, we are building ethical policies and principles that address the unique challenges of:
*   Experiencer engagement
*   Evidence collection and claims evaluation
*   Epistemic pluralism and scientific neutrality
*   Public and professional responsibility
*   Research funding and disclosure practices
This initiative will expand upon work SUAPS leadership has already begun, including:
*   The _Policy on Ethical and Professional Handling of UAP Experiencers_
*   Conceptual drafts related to relational ethics and epistemic humility, influenced by Jensine Andresen’s _Hyperconflation_ (2023)
*   Draft oversight language for internal and donor-directed research funding mechanisms
* * *
## 🔍 What This Project Involves
*   Collaborative development of one or more core policy documents and ethical statements
*   Review of prior SUAPS materials and relevant literature
*   Optional subgroup formation (e.g., Research Ethics Panel, Experiencer Engagement Panel)
*   Regular updates at quarterly Council meetings with asynchronous discussion in between
*   Shared authorship and co-signing opportunity for the final framework(s)
* * *
## 🛠️ Deliverables (Tentative)
*   Phase I: Review & consolidation of existing materials
*   Phase II: Drafting of the Institutional Ethics Statement
*   Phase III: Peer feedback and formal Council recommendation to SUAPS Leadership
*   Phase IV (optional): Development of an Ethics Advisory Subcommittee or review process
* * *
## 🤝 Goals
*   Establish shared principles that shape how SUAPS engages with the public, researchers, and evidence
*   Build alignment and trust within the Advisory Council itself
*   Strengthen SUAPS’ institutional integrity, reputation, and scholarly posture
* * *
We look forward to beginning this important project together as a Council. Further details and documents will be shared as part of your onboarding packet. Please feel free to bring ideas, questions, or references to our first full Council meeting.

# Processes

Documented processes, also known as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), can streamline your operations by creating step-by-step instructions for all your repeatable workflows. This makes all that knowledge accessible to new and existing team members, ensuring efficiency and consistency in execution.

Create subpages to document each of your team's processes and the subpage will appear in the Subpages section above.

## Marketing Strategy for the Society for UAP Studies

**Introduction:** The Society for UAP Studies (SUAPS) is a nonprofit organization devoted to facilitating the rigorous scholarly study of Unidentified Anomalous/Aerospace Phenomena (UAP) [thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena).
As we launch a dedicated marketing department from scratch, our goal is to build a vibrant global community around SUAPS’s mission, secure sustainable funding, and elevate the Society’s brand identity. We aim to shift the financial burden off of scholars (who currently pay membership dues[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=This%20is%20considered%20full%20membership,professionals%20devoted%20to%20UAP%20Studies)) and instead engage **100,000 enthusiasts contributing ~$5/month** (“the price of a coffee”[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=Community%20Supporters%20are%20part%20of,from%20a%20range%20of%20disciplines)) along with policy influencers and major donors. In return, supporters will fund research initiatives (like the planned **AURA** program to accelerate UAP research) and receive tangible value for their contributions. This document outlines our target personas, brand archetype, visual identity (including color palette), and comprehensive marketing strategies to achieve these objectives.
# Target Personas and Stakeholders
To maximize outreach, we identify **four key personas** crucial to SUAPS’s success. Each persona has unique motivations and needs, requiring tailored messaging and channels:
### 1\. **The Academic Scholar (Affiliate Member)**
**Profile:** University professors, researchers, and scholars in relevant fields (physics, astronomy, psychology, history, etc.) who are interested in UAP studies. Many are SUAPS “Affiliate” members – academics and professionals devoted to UAP research[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=This%20is%20considered%20full%20membership,professionals%20devoted%20to%20UAP%20Studies). They typically hold advanced degrees and value credibility and academic rigor.
**Motivations and Needs:**
*   **Research Support:** Access to grants, funding, and free resources (journal articles, data, labs) to advance their UAP research without financial barriers. They want SUAPS to provide infrastructure (e.g. research **grants, fellowships, and an academic journal**) so they can focus on science[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena)[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20purpose%20of%20this%20is,The%20Journal%20of%20UAP%20Studies).
*   **Scholarly Community:** A peer network of serious thinkers for interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. They seek conferences, workshops, and working groups that foster academic discourse on UAP[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=According%20to%20Cifone%2C%20one%20of,%E2%80%9D)[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Along%20with%20Peters%20and%20Eghigian%E2%80%99s,the%20application%20of%20citizen%20science).
*   **Professional Recognition:** Opportunities to publish (e.g. in _Limina: The Journal of UAP Studies_) and to enhance their CV by affiliating with a reputable scholarly society. Being part of SUAPS’s Advisory Board or committees provides prestige and influence in shaping a nascent field.
**Pain Points:** Affiliate scholars are expected to pay membership dues (~$10/month) to offset operating costs [societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=This%20is%20considered%20full%20membership,professionals%20devoted%20to%20UAP%20Studies)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=). This pay-to-play model can deter participation. They may also face stigma in academia around UAP research, so **maintaining scientific credibility** is paramount.
**Marketing Approach:** To attract and retain scholars, we will:
*   Emphasize **free membership for academics** (only when our community supporters membership ramp up allows so) so that _“scholars should pay nothing for their work”_ (as per our new policy). This will be a key policy change to publicize. We’ll highlight that SUAPS has shifted to community funding so academics can pursue research without financial burden.
*   Promote the **resources and support** we offer: e.g. travel grants, a research portfolio program (Phase 0 “open incubator” for exploratory projects), internal grant administration, and a disciplinary home for UAP studies. We will communicate success stories (e.g. scholars receiving SUAPS mini-grants or mentoring that led to publications).
*   Use **academic channels**: LinkedIn posts, university partnerships, and targeted outreach to departments (astronomy, etc.). We will share calls for proposals and conference invitations on academic listservs and networks. For example, a mass email to relevant academic associations announcing _“Free Affiliations open – join the Society for UAP Studies to collaborate on funded UAP projects.”_
*   Leverage **scholar ambassadors**: existing respected members can champion SUAPS in their circles. Testimonials about SUAPS’s rigor and interdisciplinary spirit will reassure new academics that _“the Society… upholds free, open curiosity with rigorous standards of critical scholarship ”_[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=While%20we%20are%20in%20conversation,rather%20than%20dogmatic%29%20skepticism), distinguishing it from fringe groups.

### 2\. **The Enthusiast Supporter (Grassroots Community)**
**Profile:** An international community member fascinated by UAP who is not an academic, but is educated and passionate about the topic. This persona could be a STEM worker, an educated layperson, or a citizen scientist. They follow UAP news, podcasts, and social media. We aim to convert these engaged followers into **Community Supporter** members donating a small amount monthly (e.g. $6–$9). SUAPS envisions _100,000_ such supporters worldwide contributing the equivalent of “2 espressos a month.”
**Motivations and Needs:**
*   **Curiosity & Inclusion:** They want to be part of the discovery process and stay informed about _real_ UAP research (beyond tabloids and speculation). They crave credible information and updates on new findings, expeditions, and studies. Being _included_ in a scientific endeavor excites them.
*   **Making an Impact:** This persona likely can’t do research themselves, but they feel that by funding SUAPS they are **contributing to groundbreaking science**. It’s a form of citizen participation – a way to help answer the mysteries of UAP in a responsible way.
*   **Community & Recognition:** They appreciate belonging to a like-minded community. Any recognition (even a simple “thank you” or seeing their contribution acknowledged in a project update) is meaningful. They also value **perks** in return for support – things like exclusive content, events, or merchandise make the experience rewarding [societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/products?srsltid=AfmBOorgpqOTnIBIyEezapNBYbYB9O51XlLznd6a1PADPfhW_khiYh0p#:~:text=Our%20products%2C%20thoughtfully%20designed%20by,but%20don%27t%2C%20please%20reach%20out).

**Pain Points:** They might be overwhelmed by misinformation in ufology circles. They seek **trusted experts** (the scholars above) to filter fact from fiction. Also, they want to ensure their $5/month truly goes toward progress (transparency is key). If they don’t feel engaged or see results, they could lose interest or trust.

**Marketing Approach:** Our grassroots marketing will convert these enthusiasts into proud supporters:
*   **Value Proposition (“Product” for Supporters):** We will clearly define what supporters get for their $5/month. This “Member Benefits” package could include:
    *   **Insider Content:** A monthly _“UAP Research Update”_ newsletter written in accessible language, sharing behind-the-scenes progress on projects (e.g. _Baltic Sea Anomaly Expedition highlights_, preliminary research findings, interviews with scientists). This makes supporters feel like part of the journey.
    *   **Exclusive Events:** Access to periodic **members-only webinars or Q&As** with UAP experts. For example, a livestream “Ask Me Anything” with SUAPS researchers or a private debrief after an expedition. Community members currently already get special events and course discounts[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=resume%20or%20CV,be%20a%20Society%20community%20supporter); we will heavily market these perks and add more interactive online meetups to increase engagement.
    *   **Educational Resources:** Perhaps free or discounted enrollment in SUAPS online mini-courses and seminars[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=resume%20or%20CV,be%20a%20Society%20community%20supporter). We can frame it as _“your donation not only funds research, but also gets you an education in UAP studies from top scholars.”_
    *   **Community Recognition:** Digital badges or a thank-you page listing supporters (opt-in) on our website can acknowledge them. Gamified milestones (like exclusive pins or merch after 1 year of support) can encourage retention.
    *   **Merchandise and Discounts:** Supporters could get a promo code for SUAPS merchandise (shirts, mugs, etc.) as a welcome gift. Our merch is designed to both fundraise and let supporters proudly display their affiliation [societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/products?srsltid=AfmBOorgpqOTnIBIyEezapNBYbYB9O51XlLznd6a1PADPfhW_khiYh0p#:~:text=Our%20products%2C%20thoughtfully%20designed%20by,but%20don%27t%2C%20please%20reach%20out). For example, wearing a _“SUAPS Supporter”_ t-shirt fosters identity and word-of-mouth marketing.
*   **Storytelling and Transparency:** We will use storytelling to show how community contributions make a difference. Concrete examples: _“Your coffees funded this!”_ – a social post might say 5000 supporters helped send an expedition team to investigate the Baltic Sea Anomaly. (Indeed, SUAPS recently supported a Baltic Sea Anomaly research expedition led by Swedish explorers, who returned safely with new data [x.com](https://x.com/editorlimina#:~:text=Limina%20,led%20by%20the%20ocean%20explorer).) We will report outcomes back to supporters, closing the loop. This transparency builds trust and loyalty [ascb.org](https://www.ascb.org/careers/showing-science-out-bringing-money-in-science-outreach-as-a-vital-tool-to-promoting-research-funding/#:~:text=ASCB%20www,offers%20grants%20for%20ASCB)[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-engage-scientists-donors-skills-non-profit-leadership-a4dic#:~:text=How%20can%20you%20engage%20scientists,Scientists%20come).
*   **Social Media Outreach:** Enthusiasts are active on platforms like **Twitter (X)**, YouTube, Reddit, and Facebook groups for UAP. We will have a strong presence on all **recommended channels** – posting regular engaging content:
    *   Twitter/X for quick updates and news (e.g. live-tweeting conference highlights or new findings).
    *   YouTube for slightly longer content – perhaps a biweekly video series or podcast featuring discussions on UAP science (similar to SCU’s podcast) [explorescu.org](https://www.explorescu.org/#:~:text=,Membership%2FPartners)[explorescu.org](https://www.explorescu.org/#:~:text=). Consistency is key; a schedule like weekly Twitter threads, biweekly YouTube livestreams, and monthly newsletters has been suggested to keep the community hooked.
    *   Instagram and TikTok (if capacity allows) for more visual storytelling – short clips from expeditions, behind-the-scenes lab footage, or “mythbusting” reels. These can attract younger international audiences.
    *   Facebook and LinkedIn for official announcements, event invites, and to tap into existing UAP interest groups. (Facebook has many UFO enthusiast communities; LinkedIn can reach professionals who quietly follow UAP developments.)
    *   **Community Platform/App:** SUAPS already offers an app and member forums on the website[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=,Professional%20Code)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=,Donations). We will invigorate these by encouraging supporters to discuss and network there (for example, hosting a moderated **Community Reading Circle** or discussion thread around each new journal issue[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=Society%20for%20UAP%20Studies%20,Recent%20Blog%20Posts)). Fostering peer-to-peer interaction increases their sense of belonging.
*   **Call-to-Action Campaigns:** To reach 100k members, we’ll run coordinated campaigns with a compelling CTA such as _“Join the 5-Dollar UAP Mission.”_ This can involve:
    *   Referral incentives (current supporters get a small reward for each friend they sign up).
    *   Collaborations with influencers or podcast hosts in the UAP space to promote our membership. (For instance, appearing on popular science podcasts or UFO YouTube channels to pitch SUAPS’s approach as _“the serious way to contribute to UAP science.”_)

### 3\. **The Policy Maker / Influencer**
**Profile:** Government officials, legislators, or agency representatives (e.g. within defense, aviation safety, or science agencies) and thought leaders who can influence policy or public funding for UAP research. This includes staffers on relevant committees, public servants in science and tech policy, and international counterparts (since UAP is a global issue). They may not engage publicly with UAP due to stigma, but privately they monitor credible developments (e.g. NASA’s UAP study, Pentagon reports, etc.). We want them to see SUAPS as a **go-to resource and partner** for evidence-based insights.
**Motivations and Needs:**
*   **Reliable Information & Expertise:** They need factual, well-researched information to guide decision-making (e.g. whether to fund UAP research, how to respond to public concerns, etc.). They will value SUAPS’s scholarly approach as it provides data and analysis free from sensationalism.
*   **Public Benefit & Safety:** Policy makers are concerned with national security (if UAP might pose aviation hazards or defense issues) and scientific advancement. If SUAPS can produce research that informs these areas, it aligns with their mandate.
*   **Credibility:** They are risk-averse to associating with anything perceived as “fringe.” Demonstrating SUAPS’s academic credibility (peer-reviewed publications, partnerships with universities, distinguished board members) is crucial for engagement.
**Pain Points:** They face political and public scrutiny. Any information they use must be from a **trusted authority**. If SUAPS is not well-known, they might overlook it. Also, their time is limited – they won’t join as paying members, but we need their attention and support in other ways (policy endorsements, inclusion of SUAPS in research grants or hearings).
**Marketing Approach:** To attract policy makers and institutional allies, we will:
*   **Establish Thought Leadership:** Produce **policy briefs or white papers** summarizing key insights from UAP research in plain language, with clear recommendations. For example, a brief on “UAP and Aviation Safety: Research Findings & Recommendations” could synthesize data from SUAPS studies to inform agencies. We’ll distribute these to relevant governmental bodies and at policy conferences.
*   **Leverage SUAPS Experts:** Encourage our academics to participate in public forums – such as testifying at government hearings or serving on advisory panels. (Dr. Cifone or others could volunteer as subject-matter experts to bodies like NASA’s UAP panel or the U.S. Congressional hearings.) Being present in those arenas raises SUAPS’s profile as an authority.
*   **Direct Outreach:** The marketing team (in collaboration with our **International Relations division** and board) will identify key policy contacts in different regions. We have members on almost every continent, giving us entry points to various countries (truly an _international_ network[x.com](https://x.com/editorlimina#:~:text=Limina%20,led%20by%20the%20ocean%20explorer)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=UAP%20RESEARCH%20ECOSYSTEM)). We’ll send personalized letters/emails introducing SUAPS and its mission, along with invitations to our public events (e.g. _“Attend our annual UAP Studies conference – hear the latest science”_). For legislators or agency leads, a succinct **one-pager** highlighting SUAPS’s mission and the societal importance of UAP research will be prepared.
*   **Highlight Community Backing:** Policy folks will take notice if there is a large, organized constituency. As our grassroots supporter base grows, we can truthfully say “**100,000 citizens worldwide support this research**.” Demonstrating such public engagement can encourage policy makers to pay attention (it signals voter interest and broad appeal). We might even coordinate an advocacy campaign where our supporters (persona #2) send letters to representatives about supporting scientific UAP studies – effectively turning our membership into a advocacy group when needed.
*   **Events & Partnerships:** Host high-visibility events that bridge science and policy. For instance, an **“Executive Briefing on UAP”** webinar where we invite both scientists and defense/government representatives to dialogue (under Chatham House rules if needed). We can also partner with think tanks or science policy NGOs to co-sponsor conferences, lending extra credibility. If budget allows, a small **capitol hill reception** or international equivalent around a SUAPS report release could get policy influencers in the room informally.
By positioning SUAPS as a **neutral, scholarly convener** (a place of “positional neutrality” where diverse standpoints meet[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=dialogue%20can%20be%20found%20listed,here)), we appeal to policy makers who need unbiased arenas for discussion. Over time, the goal is that SUAPS’s research will be cited in official studies (for example, contributing to reports by national academies or committees on UAP). This persona might not bring in money directly, but their support can unlock grants and create an environment where UAP research is taken seriously.
### 4\. **The Major Donor (Philanthropist/Investor)**
**Profile:** High-net-worth individuals (HNIs), family foundations, or corporate sponsors with an interest in science, aerospace, or unexplained phenomena. Some may be **visionary philanthropists** drawn to bold, unconventional causes – the kind who funded SETI or space exploration in the past. Others might be tech entrepreneurs or investors intrigued by the advanced science (e.g. sensor technology, AI, aerospace) that UAP research entails. They could also include science-fiction fans turned benefactors, or even organizations like aerospace companies seeking corporate social responsibility outlets.
**Motivations and Needs:**
*   **Impact and Legacy:** They want to fund something that could lead to historic discoveries or societal benefit. UAP research is high-risk, high-reward – a chance to be part of possibly paradigm-shifting science. A donor might imagine their support helping answer “Are we alone?” or improving national security. We should appeal to that sense of _vision_.
*   **Evidence of Rigor:** Major donors will conduct due diligence. They need to see that SUAPS has a solid plan and competent team to execute research. They’ll look for indications of scientific rigor (peer-reviewed outputs, partnerships with universities, a clear research roadmap) to ensure their money is well spent.
*   **Recognition (or Discretion):** This splits: some donors want public recognition (naming rights, publicity), while others prefer discretion (given the topic’s controversial history). We should be prepared to offer both options, e.g. “The _YourName_ Research Fellowship in UAP Studies” for those who want a legacy, or confidential briefings and results sharing for those who stay behind the scenes.
*   **Alignment with personal interests:** If a donor has a background in, say, aerospace tech, they’ll be excited if we have projects in that area (like a project on advanced propulsion, which we do offer as a course[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=Physics%20of%20Exotic%20Propulsion) and likely research topic). Matching donor interests with specific project opportunities is key.
**Pain Points:** Big donors are approached by many causes; UAP research might seem niche or speculative to some. We must overcome skepticism by showing UAP studies is an emerging **academic field with credible scholars** (not a fringe hobby). Also, some may worry about public perception – we need to normalize UAP research as legitimate (which overall branding helps to do).
**Marketing Approach:** Engaging major donors requires a personalized, high-touch strategy, often under the umbrella of **development/fundraising** but closely tied to marketing messaging:
*   **Develop a Compelling Case for Support:** We will create a professional **donor prospectus** that outlines SUAPS’s strategic plan and funding needs. This document will resemble a business investment prospectus, but for a nonprofit cause. It will include:
    *   **Our Vision & Mission:** Why UAP studies matter (e.g. potential scientific breakthroughs, national security implications, inspiring the next generation of scientists).
    *   **Strategic Initiatives:** A menu of fundable projects, such as the _Accelerated UAP Research Initiative (AURA)_ which consolidates exploratory research proposals into a portfolio ready for donor funding. Each project will have a brief summary, objectives, and budget outline. For example, Project A: “Baltic Sea Anomaly Expedition Phase 2 – detailed underwater mapping and sample analysis” requiring $X funding; Project B: “UAP Sensor Network Pilot Program” requiring $Y, etc. This gives donors options to align with their interests.
    *   **Phase 0 to 6 Research Pipeline:** We can demonstrate that we have a clear process to take research from idea to execution and publication. Emphasize that Phase 0 (community-funded ideas) feeds into Phase 1+ where donor funding scales promising projects – _i.e._, their big donation will fuel the most vetted, promising studies that emerged from our grassroots-supported pipeline. This _“product funnel”_ approach merges scientific rigor with business strategy, making donors more confident that good ideas won’t slip through funding cracks.
    *   **Impact Metrics:** We will highlight what SUAPS has achieved so far with minimal resources (e.g. launched a peer-reviewed journal, organized conferences with international scholars, supported an expedition, etc.). Then project what could be achieved with donor funding (e.g. “With $4.5M/year, we can support 10 major research projects and 50 graduate research fellows”). Showing a **budget allocation** and how donor dollars would be used transparently is critical.
    *   **Testimonials and Endorsements:** Quotes from respected academics or even public figures praising SUAPS’s work. If we have any supportive statements from, say, participants of our conferences or from the recent **NASA UAP report** referencing academic engagement, include those to boost credibility.
*   **Relationship Building:** The marketing director (or development director) will identify and cultivate relationships with potential donors. This might mean networking at space/science events, or getting introductions via our board members. We can host small private gatherings or Zoom briefings exclusively for high-capacity prospects, where SUAPS scientists share exciting developments (creating a sense of insider privilege for donors). Regular personalized updates can keep them warm.
*   **Public Recognition:** We’ll create opportunities for donors to get recognition if they want it. For instance, our website and events can have a “Presented by \[Donor\]” for a significant gift. Annual reports will list major donors (with permission). We could also launch an **Honorary Council** or “Founder’s Circle” for donors who give above a certain threshold, granting them a title and perhaps a seat at advisory meetings. This taps into their desire for influence and acknowledgement.
*   **Collaboration with Community Funding:** We will demonstrate to major donors that SUAPS has a broad base of popular support (the small donors community), which shows _social proof_ of our relevance. As mentioned, having a **“pitch-ready portfolio”** of projects with public backing makes it easier to sell to donors. We can say, _“Look, our members have incubated these 20 project ideas with their grassroots contributions; with your major gift, we can take the top 5 and fully execute them, yielding publishable results.”_ This combined model of community + major donor funding is innovative and attractive, as it shows momentum.
By aligning our messaging to each persona’s interests, we ensure everyone – from a $5/month supporter to a $500k donor – understands _“What’s in it for me”_ and feels a personal connection to SUAPS’s mission. Next, we’ll refine the overarching brand identity that ties all these efforts together.

# Brand Archetype and Identity
**Brand Archetype:** SUAPS’s brand should embody **The Sage archetype** – the wise scholar seeking truth. This archetype is defined by a motto: _“the truth will set you free”_[ebaqdesign.com](https://www.ebaqdesign.com/blog/sage-archetype#:~:text=The%20Sage%20archetype%20is%20defined,of%20truth%2C%20knowledge%2C%20and%20wisdom), which resonates perfectly with our mission of pursuing knowledge about UAP in a rigorous way. As a Sage brand, SUAPS stands for **wisdom, knowledge, and credibility**. We position the Society as the trusted authority in a field filled with speculation. Like a Sage, we value facts and insight over hype. We share knowledge freely (open courses, published research) because illuminating the unknown is our driving force.
In practice, embracing the Sage archetype means our brand voice and persona will be:
*   **Intelligent and Inquisitive:** We communicate with depth and thoughtfulness. SUAPS asks big questions and invites everyone to explore answers through empirical study. For example, our blog posts and social media will maintain a tone of intellectual curiosity – we are excited by discovery, but also careful and analytical.
*   **Authoritative yet Approachable:** As a Sage, we provide reliable information and education. We cite sources, use data, and feature expert opinions to back our statements (much as we’re doing in this document!). However, we avoid talking down to our audience – instead we act as a mentor or guide. _Everyone_ – from PhD to enthusiast – should feel welcomed to learn. This dual tone (expert but inclusive) builds trust across all personas.
*   **Neutral and Ethical:** We are **neutral ground** for UAP discussions[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=dialogue%20can%20be%20found%20listed,here), not swayed by any extreme viewpoint. The Sage archetype also fears ignorance and prides itself on integrity[ebaqdesign.com](https://www.ebaqdesign.com/blog/sage-archetype#:~:text=Sage%20brands%20are%20aimed%20towards,a%20high%20value%20on%20quality)[ebaqdesign.com](https://www.ebaqdesign.com/blog/sage-archetype#:~:text=People%20rely%20on%20them%20to,better%20understanding%20of%20their%20surroundings). Thus, our communications will be transparent (admitting what we _don’t_ know, as well as what we do) and principled (no sensationalism or unfounded claims). This aligns with our professional code of conduct.
*   **Wise and Forward-Looking:** We connect past knowledge to future possibilities. In content, we might reference historical cases or scholarly theories and then discuss cutting-edge research. This shows we have a long-term perspective – positioning SUAPS as a _thought leader_ that understands context and can envision the path ahead.
Importantly, SUAPS’s Sage identity differentiates us from pop-culture “UFO” brands. Where others might use a Hero archetype (“fighting to reveal alien truth!”) or an Explorer archetype (“adventure into the unknown!”), our primary identity is the Sage – _the learned society that carefully analyzes the phenomenon_. This doesn’t mean we can’t have a streak of adventure (after all, exploring the unknown is exciting). We can blend a **secondary archetype** of the **Explorer** – evoking the spirit of discovery and pushing boundaries of knowledge. The Explorer side of our brand celebrates curiosity and the courage to venture into new intellectual territory, which certainly fits our research ethos. In messaging we might occasionally use phrases like “exploring new frontiers of science,” which tap the Explorer imagery, but always grounded in the Sage’s wisdom and caution.
The third component to our personalized brand tone is the Magician. With the Sage, we are saying that we can providing structure for interdisciplinary research. We are opening doors for dialogue across science, humanities, and public curiosity by adding the Explorer. What is missing is A sense of _transformation_ — not just _studying_ the unknown, but helping people _reframe_ what’s possible, that's where the Magician comes in. It expands our brand identity from _credible and curious_ to _transformative and visionary_—without compromising the intellectual rigor of the Sage or the openness of the Explorer.

By defining our archetype, we ensure consistency in how SUAPS presents itself. Whether it’s a tweet, a press release, or a conference brochure, the tone should reflect _scholarly curiosity_. Visuals too can reinforce this (e.g. images of books, labs, telescopes, as well as horizons and stars for that Explorer feel).
# Visual Identity and Color Palette
A strong visual identity will make SUAPS recognizable and convey our values at a glance. We already have a logo, which we will continue to use. The next step is defining a **color palette and design scheme** that complements that logo and the brand personality:
*   **Primary Color – Midnight Blue / Navy (#0D1B2A):** A deep blue will be our foundation. Blue is often associated with **trust, intelligence, and depth**, making it ideal for a Sage brand. The “midnight” tint also evokes the night sky, linking to the aerospace aspect of UAP. This color will appear in our logo (if not already) or backgrounds of key materials (website header, banners, etc.). It signals credibility and calm expertise. (Think of how academic institutions and NASA use blue to convey authority.)
*   **Secondary Color – White (#FFFFFF) and Light Grey (#F0F0F0):** Ample white space and light grey will keep our designs clean and readable. White represents **clarity and truth** – aligning with our motto of shining light on the unknown. White text on a navy background (as seen on our website) is clean and high-contrast[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=The%20Society%20for%20UAP%20Studies,managed%20and%20published%20by%20the), aiding accessibility. Light grey can be used for backgrounds in print or web to add a subtle structure without overwhelming. These neutral tones support the Sage’s no-nonsense clarity.
*   **Accent Color – Golden Yellow (#F5A623):** To balance the cool seriousness of blue, a pop of warm color will inject energy and draw attention to key elements. We propose a vibrant gold as an accent. Orange-gold hues symbolize **enthusiasm, creativity, and illumination** (imagine a sunrise or a lit lamp – knowledge). We can use this accent sparingly for call-to-action buttons (“Join Now”), important highlights in infographics, or event announcements to create excitement. For example, our “Donate” or “Subscribe” buttons might be orange to stand out. Gold could also tie to the idea of a “golden opportunity” or a beacon. Importantly, orange contrasts well with navy blue, making for an eye-catching combo that still feels professional. _(Note: If our existing logo has a color element – e.g. some logos incorporate a red or orange dot for a sun or a stylized UAP – we’ll ensure our chosen accent matches or complements it.)_
*   **Support Colors – Black (#000000) and Charcoal Grey (#333):** Black or dark grey can be used for text (especially on light backgrounds) and tertiary elements. Black conveys sophistication and also the literal expanse of space. In presentations or videos, a black background with white text might sometimes be employed for dramatic effect (e.g. showing a quote or statistic). However, we’ll be careful not to overuse pure black in branding (to avoid a heavy or ominous feel); charcoal grey can soften it while still providing contrast.
*   **Additional Accent – Teal or Cyan (optional) (#29ABE2):** As an optional secondary accent, a teal/cyan could be introduced, especially in digital media. Teal has a modern, innovative connotation and relates to technology and the ocean (relevant if we highlight undersea aspects of UAP like the Baltic Sea anomaly). For instance, data visualizations or graphs in reports might use a teal alongside the orange and blue for multiple data series. This shouldn’t clash: teal is analogous to blue and can fit a cool color scheme, but we’ll use it minimally to avoid diluting brand cohesion.
**Palette Rationale:** Overall, this palette combines **knowledge (blue)**, **clarity (white)**, and **inspiration (gold)**. It balances the **serious academic tone** with a hint of **forward-thinking energy**. It’s also versatile for various media: blue/white/orange will work well on the website, printed brochures, merchandise, and even presentation slides. For example, a slide might have a navy background, white title text, orange bullet points – professional yet not boring.
Our **typography** will further reinforce identity – we should choose clear, elegant fonts (perhaps a serif font for headers to indicate academia, paired with a clean sans-serif for body text for modern readability). Consistency in fonts and colors across all materials will make SUAPS instantly recognizable.
We will document these brand guidelines (logo usage, colors with hex/Pantone codes, fonts, imagery style) in a simple **Brand Guide** to ensure all team members and partners present a unified image. This is important as we expand internationally – no matter who creates a flyer or social post, it should look and _feel_ like SUAPS.
# Marketing Channels and Tactics
With personas defined and a strong brand identity in place, we will deploy an integrated marketing mix to reach our audience globally. Because our society is international[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=The%20Society%27s%20first%20annual%20UAP,Studies%20conference)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=UAP%20RESEARCH%20ECOSYSTEM), we’ll utilize **digital channels primarily**, supplemented by selective in-person outreach at events. Below are key channels and how we will use them, aligned with our earlier persona strategies:
*   **Website and SEO****:** Our website ([societyforuapstudies.org](http://societyforuapstudies.org)) is the central hub for information – it already hosts our mission, publications, events, and membership info. We will ensure the site is **optimized for conversions**: clear calls to action (Join, Donate, Subscribe) on the homepage in our accent color, easy navigation for each persona (e.g. a section “For Researchers,” “For Enthusiasts,” “For Donors”). We’ll add a landing page specifically pitching the $5/month community membership with an engaging explainer (perhaps a short video and testimonials). Search Engine Optimization will be important so that anyone searching UAP research finds SUAPS. We’ll create content (blog articles, FAQs) around keywords like “UAP research organization,” “scientific UFO studies,” etc., to boost our visibility. Given our blog content and journal, we have rich material – ensuring those pages are indexed and interlinked will draw organic traffic from curious readers.
*   **Email Marketing:** Building an email list is critical for sustained engagement. We will implement pop-ups or sign-up bars on the website (“Subscribe for updates on UAP research and events”) to capture emails. A **monthly newsletter** (as mentioned earlier for supporters) will actually go to all subscribers (with certain sections exclusive to paid members if needed). The newsletter can feature upcoming events, recent blog posts or Limina articles, volunteer opportunities, and a spotlight on a donor or member (“Member of the Month” story to personalize the community). Email is also how we’ll nurture casual site visitors into members: e.g. someone signs up for free updates, then gets a drip email sequence highlighting the benefits of joining and an invitation after a couple of weeks. For academics, a quarterly more formal update might be appropriate (with conference CFPs, etc.). We’ll use segmentation to avoid one-size-fits-all emails. Consistent branding in email (using our colors and logo) will reinforce our identity.
*   **Social Media:** We touched on this under personas, but to consolidate: We’ll maintain active profiles on X/Twitter[explorescu.org](https://www.explorescu.org/#:~:text=,Image%3A%20bw%20reddit), LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and possibly Instagram. Each serves a slightly different demographic:
    *   _Twitter (X):_ Great for real-time updates, science communication threads, and engaging with the broader UAP discussion (which is quite active on Twitter). We can live-tweet key comments during conferences or share “did you know?” factoids from UAP research to educate. Also, we should interact with relevant hashtags (#UAP, #UFOtwitter, #Science). Frequency: daily short posts or retweets.
    *   _LinkedIn:_ Targets academics, professionals, and potential donors in a more formal setting. Here we share press releases, job postings (we are recruiting volunteers/staff[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/societyforuapstudies_publicrelations-communications-uap-activity-7296235377630007296-_Yxa#:~:text=,our%20team%20of%20talented%20volunteers)), and thought leadership articles (e.g. an op-ed by our Director in a LinkedIn article format). LinkedIn groups for space and defense might also allow posting our updates. Frequency: a few times a week.
    *   _Facebook:_ There is a mix of general public and older audience here. We can create a Facebook Page for official news and also consider a **Facebook Group** for SUAPS Community Supporters (as SCU did for their members[explorescu.org](https://www.explorescu.org/membership-partners#:~:text=,be%20included%20in%20all%20communications)). The group (possibly private) would let enthusiasts discuss freely; our staff can moderate and share insider tidbits to keep it lively. We’ll also post event pages for our webinars or conferences to tap into Facebook’s event discovery.
    *   _YouTube:_ We will build this out for more in-depth content. Ideas: a series of recorded lectures or interviews with researchers (some could be cross-posted from our events with permission), short documentaries on our projects (imagine a 10-minute mini-doc on the Baltic Sea Anomaly expedition, featuring footage and explanations), and even a quarterly “UAP Research Roundup” video. Visual content significantly increases engagement and can be shared on other platforms. Plus, YouTube is the second-largest search engine, so having content there increases chances people find us.
    *   _Instagram:_ Useful for sharing photos from events, quote graphics of interesting findings, or short reels. The aesthetic nature of Instagram means we’ll highlight the wonder of exploration (images of the sky, lab equipment, our team at work). It skews younger, which is good to bring in new generations of supporters.
    *   _TikTok:_ If resources and comfort allow, TikTok could be a frontier to reach a very broad public. We could do myth-busting series (“UAP Fact or Fiction”), quick explainer videos on scientific concepts behind UAP, or trends like answering popular questions. This can humanize our brand (maybe younger members of our team can spearhead it).
All social media will drive traffic to our website and membership sign-ups. We will use an **integrated content calendar** so that, for example, when we publish a new blog or have a big result to announce, we tailor that announcement across channels simultaneously. Consistent hashtags or slogans (perhaps #JoinSUAPS, #ScienceOfUAP) can unify campaigns.
*   **Content Marketing & PR:** We have a wealth of content (journal papers, expert blog essays, course materials). We will repurpose these into **digestible content** for wider audiences. For example, after each issue of _Limina_ journal, the marketing team can create a summary article “5 Key Insights from the Latest UAP Studies Journal” for the blog or media pitches. We’ll maintain an official **SUAPS Blog** (continuing current posts[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorDK25gUyNJtm777iJ8U-TGF-AsRT4_e9oV9s3Bvqveu3MmZcYH#:~:text=Alien%20Abduction%3A%20Even%20if%20true%2C,impossible%20to%20believe)) with a mix of news and educational pieces. Guest posts by scholars simplifying their research for the public would work well. We’ll also actively pitch stories to media outlets: science journalists (like those at _The Debrief_, _Wired_, _Scientific American_) might be interested in our activities. Press releases will be sent out for major events (conferences, launch of AURA initiative, notable research findings). We have already gotten coverage (e.g. Micah Hanks at _The Debrief_ covered our humanities initiative[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena)); maintaining those media relationships is key. A well-placed article titled “Inside the Society Bringing Academic Rigor to UFO Research” can significantly boost our credibility and reach.
*   **Events and Conferences:** Our own events (like the annual UAP Studies Conference, colloquia, seminars) are marketing opportunities as much as they are programmatic. We should maximize public engagement with these events:
    *   Ensure some sessions are open to the public (virtually) and advertise those widely. _“Attend our keynote live online for free – experience how SUAPS approaches UAP.”_ This can funnel curious attendees into becoming members once they see the quality.
    *   Record and share highlights on YouTube/socials for those who missed it.
    *   Use events to grow partnerships: invite members of other reputable organizations (e.g. SCU, Galileo Project at Harvard) to co-host or speak, thereby cross-pollinating audiences.
    *   Participate in **external events** too: have a presence (booth or panel speaker) at UFO conventions, space/science expos, and academic conferences (like American Astronomical Society meetings, etc.). We can prepare attractive brochures and one-pagers for these events – focusing on our unique selling point: _an academic society for UAP backed by community support._
*   **Community Engagement & Customer Service:** As we grow the supporter base, maintaining a **positive community experience** is crucial. We will have dedicated staff or volunteers to moderate our forums and respond to inquiries (like a Community Manager). Quick, informative responses to emails or social media questions will show we’re active and caring. We’ll also solicit feedback via surveys: e.g. ask members what perks they value, what topics they want to learn about, etc., and use that to refine offerings. This two-way engagement increases loyalty (people support what they help shape).
*   **Grassroots Campaigns:** In addition to digital, we shouldn’t neglect simple grassroots tactics. For instance, printable flyers or an e-brochure that our passionate supporters can share in their local communities (universities, libraries, science meetups). If even 10% of 100k members each recruit one more person through personal outreach, that’s a big multiplier. We can equip them with materials and referral links.
*   **Marketing Partnerships:** Align with organizations that complement our mission. For example, we could partner with astronomy clubs, citizen science platforms (like Zooniverse), or STEM education nonprofits for co-marketing. A cross-promotion could involve hosting a joint event (like a citizen science hackathon for UAP data) or contributing an article to each other’s newsletters. Such partnerships extend our reach to audiences already inclined to be interested.
Throughout all tactics, **measurement** will be important. We’ll set KPIs for each channel (website traffic, conversion rates to membership, email open rates, social engagement metrics, fundraising totals, etc.) and track them monthly. This data-driven approach, as befits our Sage archetype, will let us refine strategy (for instance, doubling down on the channels that yield the most new donors, or improving those that lag).
# Funding Strategy Integration
Marketing’s ultimate success will reflect in funding. We anticipate **multiple revenue streams**: small community memberships (aiming for ~$5M/year if we hit 100k members), larger donations and grants, merchandise sales[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/products?srsltid=AfmBOorgpqOTnIBIyEezapNBYbYB9O51XlLznd6a1PADPfhW_khiYh0p#:~:text=Our%20products%2C%20thoughtfully%20designed%20by,but%20don%27t%2C%20please%20reach%20out), and perhaps event ticket revenue or sponsorships. Our strategy to free scholars from fees means we’ll likely phase out the $10/month Affiliate dues[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=This%20is%20considered%20full%20membership,professionals%20devoted%20to%20UAP%20Studies)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=) once other revenue grows. Communicating this shift transparently can itself be a marketing point: _“Scholars, join us for free – thanks to community support!”_ and _“Members, your contributions directly sponsor a scholar’s membership and research.”_ This framing makes donors feel like patrons of science education, which is powerful.
We will actively promote specific campaigns to fund key projects. For instance, a crowdfunding-style push: _“Help raise $100K to send our research team back to the Baltic Sea in 2025 – all Community Supporters will get live updates from the vessel!”_ Such drives create a sense of urgency and goal orientation that can spike contributions. We can host these on our site or via platforms like Kickstarter if appropriate, but having our own donation infrastructure (the **Donations page** on our site[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=,More)) with clear progress bars could work too.
For major donors, as discussed, it’s more of a consultative “sales” process. We might organize a **Founders’ Dinner** annually, inviting wealthy prospects to meet our scientists in a private setting, hear results first-hand, etc. This can convert interest into large gifts. We’ll also explore grants from institutions (e.g. national science foundations or innovative research funds). Our marketing materials (like that prospectus) double as grant application content.
Conclusion and Next Steps
Launching this marketing strategy will transform SUAPS from a quiet academic society into a **global movement for scientific UAP research**. By clearly defining our **personas** (scholars, enthusiasts, policy makers, and philanthropists) and crafting messages that speak to each, we ensure everyone touched by SUAPS feels value and inspiration. Our brand identity rooted in knowledge (Sage archetype) will build credibility, while our vibrant color palette and design will make us memorable.
## The next immediate steps include:
1. **Finalize Branding Elements:** Approve the color palette and create branded templates (for social posts, presentation slides, letterheads, etc.). Roll out the new look on the website and social profiles for a cohesive identity.
2. **Persona Onboarding Plans:** For each persona, develop a short “journey” plan. E.g. _Scholars:_ identify top 50 target academics to personally invite; _Enthusiasts:_ prepare the membership sign-up flow and welcome email series; _Policy makers:_ send introductory packets to key contacts; _Donors:_ set up meetings or calls with top prospects.
3. **Content Calendar & Team Roles:** Launch the content schedule as envisioned (assign team members or volunteers to manage Twitter daily, newsletter monthly, etc.). Hire or appoint a **Communications & PR Manager** (we have a volunteer posting for this[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/societyforuapstudies_publicrelations-communications-uap-activity-7296235377630007296-_Yxa#:~:text=,our%20team%20of%20talented%20volunteers)) to coordinate these efforts. Also, fill the **Director of Marketing** role if not already (the strategic plan noted it was approved but unfilled – recruiting someone for this is crucial to maintain momentum).
4. **Community Platform Enhancements:** Simplify the membership application for Community Supporters (currently there’s an application step with optional CV[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options#:~:text=,be%20a%20Society%20community%20supporter) – we might remove any friction here to let people join quickly). Integrate a payment system that can handle recurring $5 donations globally. Possibly launch a Patreon in parallel if that eases international payments, then migrate supporters to our in-house system later.
5. **Marketing Launch Campaign:** Coordinate a “big splash” announcement of our new direction. For example, a blog titled _“Democratizing UAP Research: SUAPS Opens Its Doors to 100,000 Citizen Supporters”_, accompanied by social media posts and an email blast. This will signal the start of Phase 0 of our growth – inviting everyone to be part of the mission. Tease this in advance (as suggested, tweets like “Big things coming – YOU can be a part of UAP research. Stay tuned.” build excitement). Then go live with the campaign, perhaps even with a live-streamed virtual event to introduce our plans and answer questions.

By executing this comprehensive plan, we expect to see **exponential growth in awareness and support** for the Society. Success will mean scholars flocking to utilize our resources, enthusiasts proudly funding and evangelizing our work, policy makers consulting our research, and generous donors fueling our projects. Ultimately, the marketing effort will help SUAPS accelerate UAP research (AURA and beyond) by uniting **community and science** – fulfilling our vision of a community-funded, academically rigorous enterprise unlocking the mysteries of UAP for the benefit of all.

# Journey Plans for Key Personas

Below are detailed engagement **journey plans** for each of the four target personas. Each plan outlines how we will guide the persona from initial awareness of SUAPS to deeper involvement, highlighting key touchpoints, channels, and messaging at each stage. We will leverage our existing tools (Wix for website/CRM, ClickUp for scheduling tasks, Slack for internal coordination) to execute these journey steps effectively.
## Persona 1: The Academic Scholar (Affiliate Member)
_Profile:_ University professors, researchers, and scholars devoted to UAP studies (often SUAPS “Affiliate” members). They value academic credibility, access to resources, and professional recognition. Our goal is to remove barriers (like membership dues) and provide a clear path for their active participation in SUAPS research and community.
1. **Awareness & Outreach:** We will reach academic scholars through professional channels and emphasize our new **free membership policy (only when conditions allow us)**. For example, a targeted email/newsletter (via Wix CRM) and LinkedIn post will announce that SUAPS now offers _zero-cost Affiliate membership_, removing the previous ~$10/month dues[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=Membership%20dues%20will%20be%20expected,similar%20professional%20or%20learned%20societies)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=). The announcement will also highlight the upcoming **AURA RFP (Accelerated UAP Research Initiative)** – a call for research proposals that offers grants and support for selected projects. This messaging (“**Scholars: your research should cost nothing – join us and get funded**”) positions SUAPS as an _enabler_ of serious UAP research, not a pay-to-play club. We’ll leverage respected members (e.g. Dr. Michael Cifone) to spread the word in their academic networks and on forums, underscoring SUAPS’s rigorous scholarly approach[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena) to alleviate any stigma concerns.
2. **Interest & Consideration:** As academics become aware, they will likely investigate SUAPS’s credibility and benefits. At this stage, we ensure that our **website** (managed on Wix) showcases our academic journal _Limina_, past events, and our interdisciplinary Advisory Board. Scholars visiting the site see that SUAPS “unites academics and professionals … committed to advancing the study of UAP through rigorous scholarly engagement”[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena). We will share **information packets** (PDFs or site pages) detailing resources available: e.g. research grants, travel stipends for conferences, working groups, and publication opportunities. An interested professor might click “Membership -> Affiliate” to see that membership is now free and comes with perks like journal access, conference discounts, and a ready network of peers. To push consideration toward action, we’ll include **testimonials** from current affiliate members (“SUAPS mini-grant jumpstarted my UAP study, and it cost me nothing to join!”) and highlight success stories (e.g. an academic who received SUAPS funding and published breakthrough research). Academics who showed interest (e.g. opened our email or clicked the link) can be **followed up** by targeted LinkedIn outreach or a personal invitation to an upcoming SUAPS colloquium, nurturing their interest.
3. **Conversion – Joining as an Affiliate Member:** Once convinced of SUAPS’s value, the scholar proceeds to **sign up**. The Wix website provides an **“Apply Now” form** for Affiliate Membership[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=Affiliate)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=Benefits%20include%20discounts%20on%20all,for%20academic%20and%20professional%20development), where they submit their CV and a brief narrative. We make this process as smooth as possible: since dues are waived, it’s purely an academic qualification check. Upon approval, they receive a **welcome email** (automated via Wix CRM) congratulating them on joining the Society. This email will recap the key benefits available immediately (access to member-only content, invitation to our Slack or forum for researchers, upcoming events) and reinforce that they’ve joined a prestigious community. _Internal note:_ we use ClickUp to notify the team of new affiliate sign-ups so that a team member (perhaps an existing scholar ambassador) can personally reach out within a few days – a personal welcome can greatly increase new member engagement.
4. **Onboarding & Activation:** In the onboarding phase, the goal is to activate the new academic member’s participation. We will **integrate them into the community** through introductions and opportunities:
    *   **Welcome Orientation:** We’ll host a brief Zoom welcome session or a Slack channel intro for new affiliates, led by a SUAPS board member or ambassador. Here we introduce the AURA initiative details, so they immediately see a chance to get involved by submitting a proposal or joining a research working group.
    *   **Resource Access:** We ensure they have access credentials to the member-only site sections (managed via Wix Members Area). This includes the _Limina_ journal archive, discussion forums, and our “UAP Studies Bibliography” resources. We might guide them to the **Community Reading Circle** forum on the site to discuss the latest journal issue – a light first engagement.
    *   **Personalized Prompt:** Based on their interest area (we glean this from their application or CV), we might send a personalized message: e.g. “Hi Dr. Smith, saw your background in atmospheric physics – we invite you to our upcoming working group on UAP sensor methodologies.” This shows that SUAPS is actively connecting them to relevant work.
    *   **Mentor/Buddy System:** If feasible, pair the new member with a more senior affiliate or Advisory Board member in a similar field. A senior researcher can welcome them, which builds immediate belonging and can encourage active participation (e.g. “Hope to see you submit a proposal to AURA – let me know if you have questions.”).
5. **Ongoing Engagement & Contribution:** After onboarding, we want to keep the scholar **actively involved** so they contribute and find value long-term:
    *   **Research Participation:** We will encourage and facilitate their involvement in SUAPS projects. For instance, they might submit a proposal to the **AURA RFP**. If their proposal is selected, they receive funding or logistical support – a big win that we will celebrate and publicize (reinforcing to them and others that SUAPS supports its scholars). If not submitting their own, they can still join a project team or serve as a reviewer for proposals, leveraging their expertise.
    *   **Academic Events:** We continue to invite affiliates to conferences, webinars, and workshops (many of which may be free or discounted for members). For example, we’ll send out an invitation to the “UAP Studies Summer Conference 2024” and explicitly encourage them to **present papers or posters**. Being featured at events increases their professional recognition (one of their motivators) and deepens commitment. We might use ClickUp to track event invite lists and ensure every affiliate gets notified and followed-up.
    *   **Publishing & Recognition:** We prompt members to publish in _Limina_ (our peer-reviewed journal) or in our blog. If they publish, that achievement (and the fact it’s with SUAPS) gives them CV value. We’ll highlight member publications in newsletters or social media shout-outs, giving them recognition. For example: “Congrats to Affiliate member Dr. X on their new publication in _Limina_!” This not only pleases that scholar but also shows others the active scholarly output within SUAPS.
    *   **Community & Networking:** Through our **forums or Slack** (if we open a Slack workspace for affiliates), academics can discuss research ideas or form interdisciplinary groups. We’ll occasionally spark discussions (e.g. post a provocative question or a recent UAP report for debate) to keep the space lively. We will also host **quarterly research roundtables** online: informal meetups where members share updates on their work. This peer network is crucial for their sense of community. We can use our existing Slack for a private “Affiliate Members” channel where quick updates and camaraderie (sharing job calls, grant notices, etc.) can occur.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Solicit their input on what resources or support they need. For instance, after the RFP process, ask participants how we can improve or what other grants they’d like to see. Scholars feeling heard will remain engaged.
6. **Long-Term Retention & Advocacy:** To retain affiliate scholars, we will continue delivering value and eventually turn them into **ambassadors**:
    *   **Impact and Transparency:** We will keep academics informed about SUAPS’s growth and impact (e.g. sending an annual report or an update on how member contributions advanced UAP science). Seeing SUAPS thrive academically (successful projects, increased funding, new partnerships) assures them that their involvement is meaningful.
    *   **Advanced Roles:** Offer avenues for seasoned members to take on leadership. For example, outstanding contributors might be invited to join the **Advisory Board** (which carries prestige and no dues[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=team%2C%20and%20sitting%20on%20the,pay%20dues%20to%20the%20Society)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=Affiliate)) or to chair a working group. We make it clear that active members have a say in shaping the society – this fulfills their motivation for professional influence.
    *   **Recognition:** Continue to recognize achievements: feature member profiles in our newsletter (“Scholar Spotlight”) or give awards (e.g. “SUAPS Researcher of the Year” announced at the annual conference). This positive reinforcement keeps them engaged.
    *   **Advocacy:** Satisfied scholars will naturally talk about SUAPS to colleagues. We will **encourage referrals** – e.g. if an affiliate brings a new academic member, we acknowledge them (maybe a thank-you note or public shout-out). Over time, this word-of-mouth expands our academic network. Our scholars can also act as **spokespeople** in their institutions: we might equip them with a slide deck or brochure about SUAPS so they can present it at other academic meetings, further boosting credibility and recruiting others.
    *   **Continual Communication:** Use our CRM to segment these members and send tailored communications. For instance, academics get emails about grant opportunities and research content (and not too much solicitation or basic explainer content, which they might find less relevant). By keeping communication **high-value and relevant**, we ensure they remain connected and don’t drift away.
## Persona 2: The Enthusiast Supporter (Grassroots Community)
_Profile:_ A passionate, educated layperson or citizen scientist fascinated by UAP, globally dispersed. They are not professional researchers but want to **contribute** via small monthly donations (~$4–$5) and stay informed of real scientific progress. They seek inclusion, reliable information, and the feeling that they’re part of a worthwhile mission. Our journey will excite them, make it easy to support, and continually show the impact of their contributions.
1. **Awareness – Sparking Interest:** We’ll meet enthusiasts where they already consume UAP content – primarily on **social media and online communities**:
    *   **Social Media Campaigns:** SUAPS will run an active campaign on Twitter (X), YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit to introduce the Society and our mission. For instance, on Twitter/X we might post a thread like “🛸 _Tired of wild UFO speculation?_ Meet the Society for UAP Studies – scientists & scholars worldwide investigating UAP with _real_ research. And _you_ can be part of it for the price of a coffee! ☕”. This highlights credibility and the low cost to join, hooking their curiosity. We will use engaging formats: short video clips on YouTube/Instagram showing our researchers in the field, or an infographic about UAP research facts vs myths.
    *   **Influencer & Community Outreach:** We’ll collaborate with popular UAP podcasters, YouTubers, or influencers (the ones “the rebelliouly curious” trust) to mention SUAPS. For example, appearing on a respected podcast or YouTube livestream to talk about our work, with a clear call-to-action: “If you’re passionate about UAP and want to actually advance the science, join the SUAPS community.” Hearing this from a source they already follow adds credibility. We might also share news in existing UFO enthusiast Facebook groups or subreddit (in a non-spammy way, e.g. a Reddit AMA with a SUAPS scientist).
    *   **Key Message:** The messaging will focus on **inclusion and impact**: “Join thousands of others in _funding real UAP research_. Get insider updates on discoveries.” By stressing _real research_ (cutting through misinformation) and that even a small contribution matters, we attract those who want to help but didn’t know how.
    *   **Timing with Events:** We will time some awareness posts around notable events. For example, when we announce the AURA RFP, we will also post: “Big news: we’re launching 5 new UAP research projects! 🚀 Want to help make discoveries like this happen? Join SUAPS as a supporter and fuel the research. #CitizenScience”. This connects the dots that _now_ is a great time to hop on, because exciting work is starting. All awareness content will point to our **website** for more info or to sign up.
2. **Interest & Consideration – Educate and Build Trust:** Once their attention is caught, an enthusiast will likely explore further before committing $5/month. We need to **educate them on SUAPS’s credibility and show what’s in it for them**:
    *   **Informative Website Experience:** On visiting our website, a supporter persona should immediately see accessible, engaging content. We’ll ensure the homepage and “About” section clearly convey that SUAPS is a serious nonprofit with academic backing (mention our 501(c)(3) status and international scholar network). We might have a short **video explainer** on the site: “Welcome to SUAPS – How your support advances UAP science,” featuring friendly faces (maybe a mix of scientists and enthusiastic supporters) explaining our mission in simple terms.
    *   **Community Supporter Page:** We have a dedicated “Community Supporter” membership page that outlines the benefits and how the $4/month is used[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=This%20is%20intended%20for%20the,is%20therefore%20open%20to%20all)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=Benefits%20include%20discounts%20on%20SUAPS,subscription%20to%20the%20Society%27s%20journal%2C%C2%A0Limina). This page will be written in an enthusiastic but clear tone, possibly FAQ style: “**Where does my $5 go?** – Directly to research and education programs (e.g. funding expeditions, lab analyses, and our free educational content). **What do I get?** – Access to exclusive updates, invites to member-only webinars, discounts on courses, and the pride of contributing to discovery!” We will highlight that it’s _just $4/month_ (“less than an espresso”)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=This%20is%20intended%20for%20the,is%20therefore%20open%20to%20all)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=) to lower the barrier. A small graphic might illustrate “100,000 supporters = a global research fund” to reinforce the power of collective contributions.
    *   **Transparency and Impact Stories:** To build trust, we’ll showcase a few concrete stories or examples on the site and social media: e.g. **Baltic Sea Anomaly Expedition** – how community support helped SUAPS partner with explorers to investigate a mysterious object under the Baltic Sea (with a photo from the expedition). We’ll report that the team _returned with new data_ and express gratitude to supporters for making it possible. Seeing proof of activities increases credibility. We will also mention upcoming projects (from AURA RFP) that supporters will be fueling. This transparency in showing outcomes and next steps is vital for earning their trust[darzin.com](https://www.darzin.com/blog/closing-the-loop-in-public-consultation-is-important-2/#:~:text=,part%20of%20good%20public%20perception).
    *   **Engagement in Dialogue:** Enthusiasts often have questions or skepticism. We’ll monitor responses on social media and via our website contact forms (using Slack internally to quickly discuss and answer queries). If someone asks “How do I know SUAPS is legit?”, we (or even existing community members) can reply pointing to our published research or the academic advisors we have. By being responsive and honest (e.g. “Great question – our Society’s journal _Limina_ is peer-reviewed, and we regularly partner with scientists. We aim for full transparency in our spending.”), we further reduce barriers to joining.
    *   **Free Content Teaser:** As part of consideration, we might offer a **free newsletter sign-up** or a downloadable “UAP Research 101” e-book in exchange for their email. This way, even if they’re not ready to pay immediately, we capture their contact and continue nurturing. Our monthly public newsletter could showcase a bit of what paying supporters get (e.g. a shortened version of the research update). Over a few weeks of receiving quality content, they may decide to upgrade to the paid supporter membership for full benefits.
3. **Conversion – Becoming a Supporter:** We make the sign-up and donation process **simple and rewarding**, so that when an enthusiast decides to support, it takes just a minute or two:
    *   **Easy Online Join:** The user clicks “Join as Supporter” on our site. Using Wix’s integrated tools, they can fill in basic info and enter payment details securely. We’ll allow common payment methods and even one-click options if possible. The **value proposition** (what they get) will be reiterated briefly on the checkout page to remind them of the perks as they commit.
    *   **Welcome & Thank-You Message:** Immediately upon joining, they see a thank-you confirmation page. We’ll customize this page to be warm and motivating: “Welcome to the SUAPS community! 🎉 You’re now part of a global network of curious minds fueling discovery. Keep an eye on your inbox for your first exclusive _UAP Research Update_ and event invites.” This positive reinforcement at the moment of conversion makes them feel good about the decision.
    *   **Instant Gratification:** We will deliver something of value right away. For example, the confirmation page or welcome email includes a link to an **exclusive welcome video** from a prominent SUAPS scientist thanking supporters for “joining the mission” and maybe revealing a cool tidbit about an ongoing project. Additionally, if we have any digital freebies (like a desktop wallpaper of a telescope image or a PDF of a recent journal article made layman-friendly), we include that as a bonus. It’s important they get _some_ reward instantly, rather than waiting weeks for the first newsletter, to cement the feeling that membership has its perks.
    *   **Community Invite:** Also at conversion, we invite them into our **member community platform**. SUAPS already has a website-based member forum and an app[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=,39)[societyforuapstudies.org](https://www.societyforuapstudies.org/membership-options?srsltid=AfmBOooiMScUAeQiLo3u0fXuXK_9NlT2XmyVr4o3z7mX1j4IT1ShFJOm#:~:text=Image%3A%20Parallel%20Lines); we will prompt new supporters to join these. For instance: “Get connected: click here to access the SUAPS Members Forum where you can introduce yourself and meet other supporters and experts!” If the Wix app allows, they can use their member login to access forums or groups. Early involvement in the community increases the likelihood they’ll stay. (If needed, we could also use Slack or Discord, but since we’re not adding new tools, we’ll stick to existing forums/app).
    *   **Internal Process:** We will use ClickUp to ensure each new signup triggers certain tasks: e.g. verify they got the welcome email (Wix can automate, but we might double-check), and perhaps a week later, a task reminds us to personally reach out if they haven’t yet joined the forum (“send a quick hey in the forum to user X who just joined, to welcome them”). These personal touches can be scaled as templates but tracked so none slip through.
4. **Onboarding & Early Engagement:** The first few weeks are crucial to turn a one-time joiner into an active, happy supporter. Our onboarding for enthusiasts focuses on **making them feel included and valued**:
    *   **Welcome Email Series:** Beyond the instant welcome, we’ll have a short automated email series for new supporters (e.g. 3 emails over the first month). The first email (Day 1) thanks them again and summarizes what they now have access to (newsletter, upcoming events schedule, forum link, merch discount code if any). The second email (Week 1) could be “Meet the Team” – introducing a couple of our scientists or volunteers, with a friendly note like “we’re all excited to have you aboard!” The third email (Week 2) might highlight the story of a discovery or project that was _directly enabled_ by supporter donations, explicitly connecting _their_ contribution to impact, which reinforces that they made a good decision.
    *   **Community Interaction:** We encourage them to post or comment in the member forum/app. For example, a moderator might start a thread, “Welcome new members! Share what got you interested in UAP.” When new supporters post there (“Hi, I’m from Italy and always loved astronomy...”), the team and other members should respond and engage. Feeling seen by the community will deepen their loyalty. If a particular new member is very active (say they comment on many posts or ask lots of questions), a team member can invite them to consider volunteering or content creation, harnessing their enthusiasm early.
    *   **Exclusive Content Access:** We’ll ensure they start consuming the **exclusive content** ASAP, since that’s a key benefit. If our monthly supporter newsletter isn’t due for a few weeks, we might send them the **previous month’s edition** as a sample (“While you wait for the next update, here’s last month’s – check out the cool interview with our research lead”). Similarly, if a webinar is scheduled soon, we send a personal invite: “Your first members-only event is coming up on \[date\] – join us live to ask our experts anything about UAP science.” Early attendance of an event can be a hook; during the event, we might even give a shout-out to “new members joining this month” (not by name unless large scale, but in general) to reinforce growth and excitement.
    *   **Merchandise and Badges:** Within the first month, we might offer a small token of appreciation. For instance, a digital **“SUAPS Supporter” badge** they can display on social media or a virtual background for Zoom. Psychologically, this helps turn their support into part of their identity (“I’m a proud SUAPS supporter!”). Additionally, if budget permits, we could send a **welcome sticker or thank-you postcard** via mail for a personal touch (though optional and depends on scale). Using ClickUp, we can keep track of who’s been sent merch or not, to manage this process.
    *   **Survey for Insight:** After about a month, we can send a brief survey (“How’s your experience so far?”). This not only gives us feedback but signals that we care about their input. Enthusiasts like being involved, so asking “What topic would you love to see researched or discussed?” engages them. We can incorporate popular feedback into future content, which closes the loop and makes supporters feel co-creators of the mission.
5. **Ongoing Engagement & Retention:** To retain grassroots supporters long-term, we must keep **delivering value, demonstrating impact, and fostering community**. Key tactics:
    *   **Regular Content & Updates:** We will stick to a consistent content calendar (managed via ClickUp to ensure regularity). For example:
        *   **Monthly “UAP Research Update” Newsletter:** A layman-friendly digest of progress on SUAPS projects, upcoming events, and a spotlight (e.g. “Researcher Q&A” or “Supporter Spotlight”). This newsletter makes them feel like insiders. We use storytelling (“Thanks to your support, our expedition team analyzed 50 hours of footage… here’s what they found”) and visuals (photos from labs or field) to keep it engaging.
        *   **Periodic Webinars/AMAs:** Perhaps every two months, host a live webinar exclusively for supporters. Topics could range from a briefing by a scientist about their current study to a panel discussion debunking a recent UAP claim with evidence. Supporters get to ask questions live. We schedule these at varied times to accommodate international members and record them for those who can’t attend. These events create a direct connection between supporters and the “action,” sustaining excitement.
        *   **Social Media Community:** We will maintain an active presence on the social platforms, and importantly, encourage supporters to interact there too. For instance, a private Facebook Group or a hashtag like #SUAPSSupporter on Twitter for members to connect. We might organize fun campaigns, like a **“Global Skywatch Night”** where on one night supporters around the world go outside, skywatch, and share their experiences/photos in the forum or on social media. This kind of activity reminds them they’re part of a _global community_, not just a solo donor.
    *   **Recognition and Belonging:** Small gestures to recognize their contribution will go a long way:
        *   We maintain a **“Supporters Wall”** on our site (with permission-based opt-in) listing first names or initials of supporters or a world map with dots where supporters are. Seeing their name or representation gives a sense of pride.
        *   When certain milestones are hit (e.g. 1-year anniversary of joining), we can send a special thank-you email (“It’s been 1 year since you joined SUAPS – in that time, look at what we’ve achieved together: \[bullet list\]. We couldn’t do it without you.”). This reinforces loyalty. We could even gamify it: e.g. a **digital badge upgrade** for being a supporter for a year, or a discount code to our merch store as a reward.
        *   If a supporter goes above and beyond (say they recruit 5 friends to join, or they volunteer in a SUAPS project), we spotlight them in the newsletter or at events (“Special thanks to \[Name\] for moderating our forum chat or for organizing a local meetup!”). This not only makes them feel valued, but inspires others to deepen their involvement.
    *   **Transparency & Trust-Building:** We will keep an open channel about how funds are used and what impact is made, _closing the loop_ between donation and result. For example, after a major project is completed, we might release a **short report or video exclusively to supporters**: “Here are the findings from Project X that _you helped fund_. This is how you made a difference.” This process of reporting back is vital in building trust and respect with supporters – letting them know what happened with their contribution and what the next step will be is a basic principle of good practice[darzin.com](https://www.darzin.com/blog/closing-the-loop-in-public-consultation-is-important-2/#:~:text=,part%20of%20good%20public%20perception). By explicitly showing _their_ role in successes, we reinforce their motivation to continue. This transparency will help prevent “donor fatigue” or cynicism, as they can see real outcomes from their $5/month[darzin.com](https://www.darzin.com/blog/closing-the-loop-in-public-consultation-is-important-2/#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20reporting%20back,communicated%20to%20those%20who%20participated).
    *   **Continuous Community Engagement:** We aim to make the community self-sustaining in enthusiasm. We’ll facilitate occasional fun or educational activities: e.g. a supporters-only **online trivia night** about UAP in science fiction vs fact, or collaborative projects like “submit a question for our next scientist interview”. We can also encourage supporter-led initiatives, like if some members want to start a local chapter or host a meetup, we provide them with guidance or materials. The more _ownership_ they feel, the more likely they stay. Our Slack (internally) will be used to coordinate with any volunteer community moderators or to respond quickly if we see engagement drop (e.g. if forum posts decline, the team plans a new topic to spark conversation).
    *   **Retention Campaigns:** Inevitably some supporters’ payments may lapse (credit card changes, etc.) or they may consider canceling. We’ll implement retention tactics: friendly reminders if a payment fails, highlighting what they’d miss if they leave (“We hope you’ve enjoyed being part of SUAPS – next month we’re unveiling some cool findings you helped make possible!”). If someone does cancel, we might send a short exit survey (to learn why) and leave the door open for return (“You’re welcome back anytime, even as a free subscriber!”). But by focusing on the above engagement, we aim to keep churn low.
6. **Advocacy & Growth:** Enthusiast supporters can become our **word-of-mouth marketers**:
    *   **Referral Incentives:** We will encourage them to invite friends. For instance, a campaign “**Bring a Friend on Board**” – if an existing supporter refers someone who also signs up, both get access to an exclusive small-group Q&A or a cool SUAPS sticker in the mail. This gives a tangible reason to refer others. We might provide them a referral link (if Wix supports that) or a simple way to let us know who they referred.
    *   **Social Sharing:** We’ll periodically create **shareable content** that supporters would proud to share – such as a public infographic summarizing a research finding or a short YouTube clip of a SUAPS scientist explaining something fascinating. We can add a gentle nudge: “If you’re a supporter, spread the word about what we’re doing!” When supporters share such content with their commentary (“I’m funding this organization – check it out!”), it brings in new people organically.
    *   **Grassroots Advocacy:** As our relationship with the community deepens, we can mobilize them for causes that help SUAPS’s mission. For example, if we want government to fund UAP research or universities to take it seriously, we could ask our supporters to sign an open letter or share a message with their representatives (with guidance provided). Since they are worldwide, even a subset taking action can amplify SUAPS’s influence. We must be careful to do this sparingly and sincerely (so they don’t feel we’re exploiting them for lobbying), but given their passion, many would be excited to help advance the cause publicly.
    *   **Feedback Loop for Growth:** We treat our enthusiastic base as partners. We’ll continue to solicit their ideas for improvement and listen. Perhaps they might suggest new membership perks or content topics – we’ll adopt good suggestions, making them feel even more invested. Their passion and satisfaction is contagious; as the community grows (toward that 100k goal), the _buzz_ they create will attract even more supporters, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and engagement.
By carefully guiding the enthusiast supporter through this journey – from initial spark to feeling like an integral part of the “UAP mission” – we maximize both their lifetime support and their role in growing our grassroots base.
## Persona 3: The Policy Maker / Influencer
_Profile:_ Government officials, legislators, agency staff, or thought leaders who can influence policy and funding related to UAP research. They are interested in **reliable data and expert insights** on UAP, but are cautious about credibility due to political risk. They won’t become paying members, but we want them as _allies_ who treat SUAPS as a go-to **expert resource** and possibly champion our cause in the halls of power. The journey here is about building trust and collaboration rather than a transaction.
1. **Awareness – Gaining Noticed by Policy Influencers:** We initiate contact by ensuring SUAPS is **visible in the right circles** and associated with expertise (not speculation):
    *   **Academic-Policy Events:** We will host or participate in public forums where policy people are paying attention. For example, SUAPS might organize a panel or webinar on “UAP and Aviation Safety” or “Scientific Approaches to UAP” and explicitly invite policy stakeholders (FAA officials, defense advisors, science agency reps). We advertise these events on LinkedIn and via emails to government contacts. Even if they don’t attend, seeing the invite with titles like “Ph.D. researchers discussing rigorous findings” frames SUAPS as serious. Additionally, presenting at third-party conferences (space policy conferences, aviation safety workshops, etc.) will put SUAPS on their radar. Our international membership can help identify such opportunities in various countries.
    *   **Earned Media and Reports:** We aim to be referenced in media or reports that policy makers read. For instance, when the **NASA UAP study report** came out, many officials paid attention. SUAPS can publish an op-ed or analysis piece in a platform like _The Debrief_ or a science policy blog summarizing the implications of that report. If a Congressional hearing on UAP occurs, we ensure a SUAPS representative submits a statement or is quoted in related news. These appearances signal to policy folks that SUAPS is a knowledgeable player. We will also produce a concise **Policy Brief or White Paper** on a relevant topic (e.g. “**UAP & Aviation Safety: What the Data Shows**” or “Academic Engagement in UAP Studies – Recommendations”). This brief will be written in non-technical language, with clear recommendations, so that a busy legislative staffer can grasp it quickly. We’ll cite credible research (including SUAPS’s own publications) to show we’re evidence-based.
    *   **Direct Outreach & Networks:** Our team (especially those on our Board who have connections) will **identify key contacts** in government and make introductions. For example, if one of our advisors knows someone at a national science foundation or defense ministry, we’ll have them introduce SUAPS via email or LinkedIn: “I’d like you to meet the director of SUAPS – they’re doing important work on UAP science.” These personal introductions can cut through the noise. We maintain a list (in ClickUp or a CRM segment) of such contacts to systematically reach out when appropriate.
    *   **Initial Messaging:** In all these awareness efforts, the message to policy makers is that _SUAPS is a neutral, scholarly resource on UAP_. We emphasize our interdisciplinary approach and “rigorous standards of academic discourse”[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena), to show we aren’t a fringe group but rather akin to a think tank or professional society. We also highlight that we have **global reach** and **public backing** (e.g. “100k citizen supporters”) to indicate widespread interest – something policy folks can’t ignore. A key phrase might be: “We offer **objective insights** into UAP – free of sensationalism – to inform responsible policy.” By framing ourselves as partners in informing and educating, we open the door for engagement.
2. **Interest & Evaluation – Building Credibility:** Once aware, a policy maker or their staff will likely quietly vet SUAPS’s credibility before engaging. At this stage, we ensure that any due diligence they do **reinforces our legitimacy**:
    *   **Robust Online Presence:** If a staffer Googles us or looks at our website, they should immediately find evidence of serious work. We’ve already curated the site content for academics and supporters; for policy folks, likely the same signs of credibility (academic advisors, journal, events with known institutions) will impress. We might add a dedicated “Policy Impact” or “Media” page listing any notable mentions: e.g. “SUAPS cited in \[Nature article\]” or “SUAPS advisors participated in NASA UAP panel (if happened)”. Seeing those signals, plus perhaps quotes from respected figures (“SUAPS brings much-needed rigor to this topic,” says \[Prof/Colonel so-and-so\]), can assure them we’re the real deal.
    *   **One-Pager and Personal Email:** We will follow up initial outreach by sending a **polished one-pager** directly to key contacts. This PDF (or printed brief for in-person meetings) succinctly covers who we are, our mission, and _why it matters to policy_. For example, it might list bullet points like “SUAPS research can inform: 1) Aviation safety protocols regarding UAP, 2) National security assessments, 3) Public communication strategies on UAP”. It will note our advisory board includes PhDs and former officials, etc. This one-pager serves as an easy reference they can circulate among colleagues. We’ll send it with a personal note: “We’d be happy to brief you or provide any expertise you need on UAP studies.”
    *   **Demonstrating Thought Leadership:** To further intrigue them, we’ll share any **published reports or articles** we have. For instance, if we have an annual report or a summary of our conference findings, we ensure it’s accessible and perhaps directly share it: “FYI, attaching our summary of the 2024 UAP Studies Symposium – it highlights academic findings that might be relevant to your committee’s work.” By giving valuable info with no ask, we position SUAPS as a helpful source. If they find the info useful, they’ll be more inclined to keep us in mind.
    *   **Behind-the-Scenes Endorsements:** We also leverage back-channel validation. If a well-known scientist or a defense expert is sympathetic to us, we might have them mention SUAPS in conversations with officials. Sometimes hearing a familiar name vouch for SUAPS (“Yes, I’m aware of them; they’re doing solid work”) can tip a policy maker from skepticism to openness. We can’t always track this, but we encourage our network to mention us in relevant policy discussions.
3. **Engagement – Two-Way Communication Begins:** Here, the policy influencer moves from passive interest to **direct interaction** with SUAPS:
    *   **Attending Events and Briefings:** A milestone is getting a policy maker (or their representative) to attend one of our events (even virtually). Suppose a staffer joins our online symposium or a webinar; we will note their attendance and perhaps follow up: “Thank you for attending – hope the discussion was useful. We’re happy to answer any questions or provide further info on that topic.” Alternatively, a legislator’s science aide might accept our offer for a private briefing. In that case, we’ll set up a **meeting (Zoom or in-person)** where a couple of our experts present key findings relevant to that office’s interests. For example, if it’s a defense committee staff, our experts might summarize data on UAP incursions and how scientific studies can help address them. This personalized approach shows we respect their time and tailor our knowledge to their needs.
    *   **Providing Expert Testimony/Advice:** If a policy window opens (say, a Congressional hearing on UAP, or a ministry forming a task force), we’ll volunteer our expertise. We might send a letter to the committee: “SUAPS would be pleased to provide expert testimony or analysis – attached are credentials of our members in relevant fields.” Even if they don’t take it up immediately, it puts us on their radar as a resource. Over time, as trust grows, they may proactively reach out: e.g. a senator’s office might call us asking, “Can one of your scientists brief us on the scientific consensus about UAP detection technologies?” Being responsive and thorough in these moments is crucial – we’ll prepare background materials quickly (using Slack to coordinate among our team to draft a response) and deliver useful information.
    *   **Policy Maker Involvement in AURA:** The launch of the **AURA RFP** can be a hook for engagement. We can inform relevant agencies about it: for instance, send NASA or defense research officials a notice: “SUAPS is now accepting proposals for its Accelerated UAP Research Initiative. We welcome collaboration or co-sponsorships.” A policy influencer seeing this might realize SUAPS is organizing research in an area they care about. Perhaps they cannot directly participate, but they might pass the info to colleagues or at least note that SUAPS is proactive. If any proposals overlap with government interests, we could even invite an agency rep to sit on the advisory panel reviewing submissions (as an observer or partner). That involvement would greatly deepen engagement, as they’d get an inside view of our process and trust our rigor.
    *   **Establish Regular Contact:** Once initial dialog is open, we maintain it gently. For example, add the policy contact to a _special mailing list_ for “Policy Updates” – a quarterly email (separate from the supporter newsletter) that highlights SUAPS developments relevant to policy (e.g. “New Journal Issue on UAP Policy released”, “Summary of UAP findings that might inform regulation”). This list would be very targeted and low-frequency, so they don’t feel spammed, but it keeps SUAPS in their inbox with high-value info. We track these contacts in our CRM and use ClickUp to set reminders for follow-ups (e.g. “Send the new policy brief to contacts X, Y next week”; “Invite Senator Z’s office to the next conference”).
4. **Collaboration & Influence – Partnering on Common Goals:** As trust solidifies, policy makers move to actively **support or utilize SUAPS** in their work:
    *   **Inclusion in Policy Discussions:** We may see officials start to reference our research or ask us to formally contribute. For example, a transport safety agency could invite SUAPS to join a **workshop on UAP and aviation**. Our role might be to present data or even help craft guidelines. We’ll enthusiastically participate, as this is a chance to directly shape policy with our insights. Another scenario: an international body (say the UN or an air traffic association) is examining UAP – having a SUAPS delegate involved or our papers circulated there would be a win. We achieve this by continuously offering value and showcasing our experts as thought leaders (so when such discussions arise, someone says “Let’s get SUAPS in here, they have the academics on this”).
    *   **Policy Endorsements of SUAPS Work:** A major breakthrough in the journey is when a policy maker **publicly acknowledges** SUAPS or our findings. This could be subtle, like a parliamentarian stating, “We have organizations like the Society for UAP Studies doing important work in this arena” during a debate, or more direct, such as a government office referencing a SUAPS study in an official report. To facilitate this, we ensure any research we publish is **accessible and shareable**. For example, if our scholars publish a paper on UAP detection, we’ll write an executive summary and send it to relevant offices with a note: “Key takeaways from this study may inform technology development – feel free to cite or contact us for more info.” If we see our work cited, we will follow up thanking them and offering further collaboration.
    *   **Influencing Funding and Support:** With growing credibility, we might influence **funding decisions**. A policy ally could help direct public research funds towards UAP studies (which might benefit SUAPS indirectly through grants or partnerships). They might also loosen restrictions, e.g. advocating for declassification of data so our academics can study it. While SUAPS can’t lobby heavily (and shouldn’t risk political alignment), having well-placed friends who see our value can lead to tangible support. For instance, we might be invited to apply for a government research grant or be subcontracted on a project, thanks to a recommendation. We will stay alert to these opportunities and be ready to act (using our internal coordination to quickly assemble proposals when a window opens).
    *   **Mutual Communication Channels:** By this stage, communication is two-way and on-going. We might set up an informal **advisory group or roundtable** that includes some policy representatives. For example, a biannual closed-door meeting where SUAPS scientists and government liaisons talk candidly about UAP research challenges and needs. This provides a forum for continuous exchange. It also helps institutionalize the relationship beyond any one champion (since officials come and go). We’d use such meetings to ensure SUAPS stays aligned with public needs (without compromising our independence).
5. **Long-Term Partnership & Advocacy:** In the final stage, policy makers see SUAPS as a **stakeholder and leader** in the field, and our relationship yields concrete support for our mission:
    *   **Policy Changes and Initiatives:** The ultimate sign of success is if our work helps shape policy or programs. For instance, a government might launch a new UAP research program or task force and include SUAPS as a partner or consultant. Or policy guidelines for scientific study of UAP might mention working with organizations like ours. We will celebrate these wins (e.g. share with our community that “Government X is partnering with SUAPS to advance UAP science”) as it also validates our credibility to all personas.
    *   **Securing Funding and Resources:** Policy allies can open doors for funding. They might help us get government research contracts or be written into legislation as recipients of support (for example, a research bill that allocates grants to non-profits studying aerospace phenomena). Even if not direct funding, they could provide in-kind support: access to data, use of facilities (like allowing our researchers to use a government lab for tests), etc. We will continue to cultivate these opportunities by demonstrating impeccable professionalism and aligning our proposals with public interest goals.
    *   **Public Advocacy and Stigma Reduction:** As SUAPS gains esteem, policy figures might start **publicly defending or promoting scientific inquiry into UAP**, reducing the stigma. For example, a high-profile official might speak at our conference or write a foreword to one of our publications. Their endorsement can greatly elevate public and academic acceptance of UAP studies. We will invite such participation whenever appropriate (“We’d be honored if you’d give opening remarks at our symposium about why government welcomes academic involvement in UAP research”). Even a short video message from a NASA or defense representative for our event can signal that SUAPS is taken seriously.
    *   **Advisory Roles:** When policy makers retire or move on, we have an opportunity to bring them into the SUAPS fold more directly. We could invite a former official who was supportive to join our **Board of Advisors** or an honorary council. This not only adds to our credibility (“Former Minister so-and-so is on our board”) but keeps their expertise accessible to us. They, in turn, might enjoy shaping the field from the non-government side. We will handle this carefully to avoid any conflicts of interest while they are in office, but post-tenure it can be a natural progression.
    *   **Sustained Communication:** Finally, we institutionalize the relationship. SUAPS becomes known among relevant agencies such that even when specific people change, the organization remains connected. We update our policy contacts list continually, introduce ourselves to new officials promptly, and highlight the broad base of public support we have (which can be persuasive to any elected official). Essentially, SUAPS transitions in their minds from an external curiosity to an **established authority**. At this point, the journey succeeds when policy makers proactively say, “Let’s see what the Society for UAP Studies has to say about this” whenever UAP issues arise. Our marketing team’s role then is to maintain that position through ongoing engagement and demonstrating value.
In summary, for policy influencers the journey is about **credibility, communication, and collaboration**. By staying non-partisan, research-focused, and responsive, we turn wary officials into partners who leverage SUAPS’s expertise, which in turn advances our mission on a systemic level.
## Persona 4: The Major Donor (Philanthropist/Investor)
_Profile:_ High-net-worth individuals or foundations interested in frontier science, aerospace, or the unknown. They could be tech entrepreneurs, wealthy science enthusiasts, or philanthropists drawn to transformative impact. They seek a **meaningful legacy and tangible results**. We need to inspire them with our vision, assure them of our competence, and steward a personal relationship. The journey will be highly individualized and **high-touch**, turning a prospect into a long-term benefactor and champion.
1. **Awareness & Prospect Identification:** Given that major donors won’t come through mass marketing, we proactively **identify and target potential donors**, while also making sure our public narrative is attractive to them:
    *   **Networking and Referrals:** We will leverage our Board and existing supporters for leads. Board members might know philanthropists intrigued by space or unexplained phenomena. We’ll ask them to discreetly identify such individuals. For example, “Who in your network cares about big scientific questions or has funded unusual research like SETI or space exploration?” Using wealth indicators and interest cues (somewhat like wealth screening software would) can help[afpglobal.org](https://afpglobal.org/crafting-donor-journey-tactics-major-first-time-and-lapsed-donors#:~:text=Know%20Your%20Audience%3A%20Major%20donors,charitable%20giving%20to%20other%20organizations). If a smaller donor in our database gives an above-average gift or notes a family foundation, we flag them as a potential major donor and gather more info.
    *   **Visibility in High-Net-Worth Circles:** We ensure SUAPS appears in the **media and events that wealthy science patrons attend**. For instance, features in publications like _Scientific American_, _Wired_, or high-profile podcasts can catch a philanthropist’s eye. If SUAPS hosts a public symposium, we might invite a few VIP guests (even if they haven’t donated yet) just to introduce them to our world. Similarly, speaking at an influential venue (like a TEDx or panel at a World Science Festival) can put us on their radar. Our message in such forums will be visionary: e.g. “Humanity stands at the cusp of understanding the unknown; SUAPS is leading that charge responsibly.” This appeals to those who dream big.
    *   **Initial Storytelling:** The narrative we craft for this persona focuses on the **high-impact potential** of UAP studies. In awareness materials (brochures, website sections, talks) aimed at wealthy donors, we emphasize that this is a _historic opportunity_ to enable paradigm-shifting discoveries (are we alone? what new physics might we learn?). We also tie it to concrete benefits: technological innovation, inspiring the next generation of scientists, ensuring national security – depending on the donor’s personal motivations. We highlight that SUAPS has a pipeline of research ideas vetted by experts and an engaged global community, meaning any large investment is amplified by public support. This combination of **visionary appeal and practical assurance** will pique the interest of the right donors.
2. **Cultivation – Personal Engagement and Building Trust:** Once a potential major donor is identified and aware, we move into careful one-on-one cultivation. The goal here is to build a relationship and align SUAPS’s needs with the donor’s passions:
    *   **Personal Introduction:** Ideally, a mutual connection (board member or friend of the donor) introduces the donor to SUAPS leadership. If not, the SUAPS Executive Director or Development Director will reach out with a **personalized letter or email**. This is not a form letter – it will reference the donor’s interests or philanthropic history: e.g. “Dr. X, I noted your foundation’s support for astrophysics research and thought you’d be interested in an area at the frontier of science that we are advancing…” We then introduce SUAPS in terms that resonate with them (if they’re an aerospace CEO, mention how UAP research could spur aerospace innovation; if they’re a science philanthropist, talk about intellectual discovery and legacy).
    *   **The Case for Support (Prospectus):** Early in cultivation, we provide a **professional prospectus** tailored to major donors. This document (which we will have prepared as part of our strategy) lays out our **vision, strategic plan, and funding opportunities** in a polished, concise way. For example, it will describe the AURA initiative as a portfolio of research projects ready to launch, each requiring a certain investment. It might list specific “naming opportunities” (e.g. “$500k – Fund an annual ‘\[Donor’s Name\] UAP Research Fellowship’ supporting young scientists” or “$1M – Launch a flagship 3-year research project on UAP sensor networks”). Seeing these options helps donors imagine how their money could make a concrete impact. The prospectus will also include credibility elements: financial info, our track record of accomplishments on a shoestring budget, endorsements from respected figures. We send this ahead of or just after a first meeting so the donor can review and come with questions.
    *   **Meetings & Vision Trips:** We will arrange **meetings (in-person if possible, or virtual)** with the donor to discuss their interests and our work. In these meetings, it’s crucial to listen as much as present. We’ll ask what excites them about UAP or science, what legacy they want to leave. We then align our projects to those interests. For instance, if the donor is fascinated by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, we emphasize our astrobiology-related research and how their gift could fund a breakthrough study in that area. We also give them an insider view of SUAPS: possibly a “vision trip” (if local, invite them to visit a lab we partner with or attend a small gathering of our scientists). If not local, a virtual tour – e.g. a Zoom where we show them our journal, website community, maybe even a short demo of an analysis being done by one of our teams. The idea is to make them feel the **excitement and potential** firsthand. Donors at this level often give based on relationships and inspiration, not just reports.
    *   **Addressing Concerns:** Major donors will have due diligence questions. We proactively address these to build trust. Common concerns: Is this credible science or pseudoscience? (We provide evidence of our academic rigor – journals, collaborations with universities, etc., to show we’re legitimate[thedebrief.org](https://thedebrief.org/academics-unite-to-bring-humanities-to-the-study-of-aerial-mysteries-at-society-for-uap-studies-event/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Society%20for%20UAP,understanding%20of%20these%20perplexing%20phenomena).) How do you use funds? (We show transparent budgets, perhaps our IRS 990 if requested, and outline how X dollars translate to Y outcomes). Who’s on your team? (We might facilitate conversations between the donor and key researchers or board members so they can vet our talent). By being open and responsive, we demonstrate professionalism. We also acknowledge the topic’s controversial past but show how SUAPS is _different_ – emphasizing our commitment to critical, empirical study over hype.
    *   **Small Engagements:** If the donor isn’t ready to commit big yet, we involve them in smaller ways to deepen interest. For instance, invite them as an observer or honorary guest to our upcoming conference (“We’d love to have you sit in on our symposium – it’s closed to the public but as a friend of the Society you’re welcome”). Or ask if they’d like to fund a small precursor (e.g. sponsor a student’s travel grant to our conference). Sometimes a _trial gift_ or experience can lead to a larger gift later, once they see outcomes. We keep track of these interactions in our CRM and use ClickUp to remind follow-ups (e.g., “Send conference proceedings to Donor X after event, along with a thank-you for attending”).
3. **Solicitation & Commitment – The “Ask”:** After cultivating the relationship and understanding the donor’s motivations, we approach the moment of **soliciting the major gift**:
    *   **Aligning the Ask with Interests:** We will propose a specific funding opportunity that matches the donor. For example, “You expressed interest in underwater exploration technology – one of our top AURA proposals is a Baltic Sea Anomaly **Phase 2 Expedition** to do detailed sub-seafloor scans. For $250,000, you could underwrite that entire project, and we’d gladly name you as the principal benefactor.” By tying the ask to what they care about, it feels like a natural extension of prior conversations rather than out-of-the-blue. Alternatively, if they prefer broader impact, we might ask for multi-year support: “Would you consider a pledge of $X per year for 3 years to establish the **UAP Research Accelerator Fund**, enabling us to support a suite of groundbreaking studies? This would essentially jump-start the field and _your contribution would be recognized as founding that wave of research_.”
    *   **Presentation of the Plan:** We deliver the ask perhaps in a formal proposal or in a meeting, depending on the donor’s style. Some donors like a **written proposal** detailing objectives, timeline, budget, and expected outcomes of the project they’d fund. We will prepare that with care, possibly including visuals (charts, photos of researchers or locations, etc.) to make it compelling. Others might respond better to an **emotional appeal in conversation** followed by a short agreement letter. We’ll gauge which approach suits each individual. In any case, we make sure to express our passion and the urgency/opportunity: e.g. “With your support now, by next year we could have the first comprehensive data on X…”.
    *   **Negotiating Terms:** Major donors might have conditions or preferences. They might want naming rights, or on the flip side, some prefer anonymity. We come prepared to accommodate (within reason). If they want their name on the outcome (e.g. the fellowship or project), we happily agree – it gives them legacy and us a selling point for others (“the _Smith_ Research Fellowship”). If they’re shy, we ensure confidentiality. Some may want a say in how funds are used: while maintaining scientific independence, we could invite them to sit on an advisory committee for the project or get quarterly updates (this involvement is usually welcome, as it keeps them engaged). We’ll also discuss the form of the gift – is it through a foundation (requiring certain reports), stock donation, etc. – and ensure our processes (via Wix CRM or our finance team) can handle it smoothly.
    *   **Closing the Gift:** Once agreed, we formalize it. For large gifts, that might mean a written **gift agreement** outlining the purpose, amount, payment schedule, and any recognition promised. Our tone remains appreciative and not overly bureaucratic – even the paperwork is an opportunity to reinforce how transformational their contribution is. When the donor officially commits (“Yes, I’ll do it”), we respond with genuine enthusiasm and gratitude, making it clear that together we are embarking on something important.
    *   **Immediate Acknowledgment:** We do not wait to celebrate the moment. Immediately upon commitment, the SUAPS President or founder will personally call or write a heartfelt thank-you letter. If the donor is comfortable with public acknowledgement, we prepare a **press release or announcement**: “SUAPS receives major gift from \[Donor Name\] to launch UAP Research Initiative.” This serves both to recognize them and to build momentum (perhaps encouraging others). If they prefer to stay behind the scenes, we still internally announce the success (without name) to motivate our team and subtly signal to other prospects that big things are happening. Internally, Slack would light up with joy at this stage – but externally we handle the messaging per the donor’s wishes.
4. **Stewardship & Impact – Delivering on Promises:** Once we have the gift, the focus shifts to **execution and keeping the donor deeply engaged** in the impact of their contribution. This stage is crucial for future retention and turning the donor into a long-term patron:
    *   **Project Launch & Donor Involvement:** We launch the funded project (or initiative) with fanfare. If appropriate, we might have a kick-off event or ceremony (virtually or in-person) where the donor is invited and applauded for making it possible. For instance, if they funded the Baltic expedition, as the team sets sail we host a send-off Zoom where the donor can give a few words alongside scientists – making them feel like a hero champion for science. We ensure the donor feels _personally connected_: perhaps giving them a token like a framed photo of the research team with a thank-you message, or a symbolic gift related to the project (e.g. an artifact or replica related to the research subject).
    *   **Regular, Personalized Updates:** Throughout the project, we keep a **steady stream of updates** flowing to the donor, far beyond what regular supporters get. This might include:
        *   Monthly short emails or a phone call from the project lead: “Here’s what we’ve been up to this month – the new sensor arrived, and we tested it… early data looks promising.”
        *   Mid-project formal reports (quarterly or semi-annual) with progress metrics, any preliminary findings, and budget spending to date. We make these reports visually engaging and jargon-free; they should be exciting to read, reinforcing that their money is actively turning into knowledge.
        *   Invitations to witness milestones: e.g. if it’s a lab experiment, maybe a live video tour of the lab; if an expedition, sending them video diaries from the field; if analysis, maybe showing them raw data first and explaining it. This level of **insider access** is something major donors crave, as it deepens their emotional investment[afpglobal.org](https://afpglobal.org/crafting-donor-journey-tactics-major-first-time-and-lapsed-donors#:~:text=Construct%20a%20Bespoke%20Experience%3A%20Major,the%20impact%20of%20their%20contributions).
        *   Problem-sharing: If challenges arise (delays, unexpected findings), we communicate them honestly and show how we’re addressing them. Major donors appreciate transparency; it builds trust that we see them as partners, not just funders.
    *   **Recognition & Inclusion:** We continue to honor their contribution throughout. That includes public recognition (assuming they agreed): their name on our website’s donor section, perhaps an acknowledgement in our journal (“This research was supported by the generous contribution of…”) or at events (“This conference session is sponsored by the \[Donor Name\] Fund”). We also involve them in our **community** in a way that suits them. For example, invite them to meet other supporters or the academic members at a VIP gathering. If they enjoy public speaking, offer a slot at our event to share why they supported SUAPS (this can inspire others). If they prefer private settings, host a small dinner with a few intellectual peers and our team to discuss big ideas. The key is they feel celebrated and part of the SUAPS family, not just a check-writer.
    *   **Feedback and Collaboration:** We treat the donor as a valued advisor when appropriate. After all, many major donors are highly successful individuals with expertise or ideas. We might seek their input: “We’re considering expanding our labs – what do you think of that direction?” or “You mentioned interest in AI; perhaps we can integrate AI analysis in the project – would love your thoughts.” By **inviting their feedback** and listening seriously[afpglobal.org](https://afpglobal.org/crafting-donor-journey-tactics-major-first-time-and-lapsed-donors#:~:text=being%20intrusive,valued%20and%20informed%2C%20not%20overwhelmed), they feel even more ownership of the success. This doesn’t mean letting them dictate scientific methods, but rather acknowledging their perspective. Some might even volunteer connections or additional resources (e.g. “I know someone at a tech company who can help with that equipment…”). We graciously accept such help, which only ties them closer to the outcome.
    *   **Internal Coordination:** We use our tools (Wix/CRM to log every interaction and preference, ClickUp to set tasks like “Send donor X the Q2 report by July 15” or “Invite donor X to panel rehearsal”) so that we never drop the ball in stewardship. The team will be aligned on treating this donor with priority attention.
5. **Renewal, Growth & Advocacy – Long-Term Partnership:** As the funded project nears completion and the donor sees the fruits of their contribution, we prepare to **renew and even expand their involvement**:
    *   **Impact Showcasing:** At project conclusion, we create a compelling **Impact Report** for the donor. It would detail the outcomes: data collected, papers published, media coverage gained, etc., and most importantly, the _significance_ of those outcomes in context. We highlight “this was possible because of you.” Perhaps include quotes from researchers (“Thanks to \[Donor\], we made a discovery about X that opens new avenues...”). If results are strong, we might organize a **dedicated event** to present them – inviting the donor, of course. For example, a small symposium where the researchers share findings with the donor and maybe other select stakeholders, followed by a celebratory toast.
    *   **Acknowledging Legacy:** If the donor’s support led to something lasting (say we established a new research unit or ongoing program), we permanently acknowledge that. E.g., the website and materials for that program carry their name or a dedication. We might also consider a plaque or award in their honor. This helps cement the sense that they’ve left a legacy within SUAPS.
    *   **The Next Ask (Upgrading):** Satisfied donors are likely candidates to give again. We approach this delicately – the relationship is not a one-off but a continuum. After celebrating the success, we discuss **future plans**: “Our work isn’t done – in fact, this project raised new questions. With your partnership, we could tackle even bigger challenges.” Essentially, we paint a picture of the _next horizon_. If their first gift was $250k, maybe the next vision is larger: perhaps funding a multi-project program or an endowment for UAP research fellowships. We’ll propose in line with their capacity and interest. Often, major donors increase gifts when they trust the organization, so a one-time project funder could become an ongoing patron or even pledge a legacy gift. We ensure they feel zero pressure – the tone is inspirational, exploring ideas together. If they are not ready for a new commitment, we remain grateful and keep them engaged until the time is right.
    *   **Broadening Their Involvement:** We also consider roles beyond money. For instance, invite them to join our **Advisory Council** or even Board of Directors if appropriate. A major donor on the board can contribute strategically and attract others. If they prefer a less formal role, perhaps they can head a fundraising campaign (using their name/prestige to draw peers) or host a salon at their home where SUAPS presents to other philanthropists. By involving them in these higher-level ways, we turn them into an **advocate** and evangelist. They might write an op-ed about why UAP research deserves funding, or speak at a philanthropic conference about their experience funding SUAPS as a model of innovative giving.
    *   **Consistent Relationship Management:** For the long term, we maintain the same level of personal touch. Remember birthdays or significant life events (send a note from the team). Share interesting tidbits outside formal reports, like “saw this article about space exploration and thought of you.” This genuine friendship approach often cements loyalty. We’ll track such personal notes in CRM (to avoid forgetting or duplicating).
    *   **Peer Influence:** Finally, we encourage and facilitate them to **influence other donors**. If they’re comfortable, we ask for referrals: “Do you know others who might be intrigued by our work? We’d love to share our story with them.” Many major donors do network with each other. A recommendation from one can open doors to others. We might co-host an event with the donor where they invite their circle to hear about SUAPS. This not only potentially brings in new funds, but it also elevates the original donor’s role as a champion (which many find rewarding in itself).
By shepherding major donors through this thoughtful journey – from initial spark of interest to deeply invested partner – we not only secure vital funding for SUAPS but also gain influential ambassadors. These donors will feel a profound connection to our mission, seeing it as _their_ mission too. They get the legacy and impact they desire, and SUAPS gains the resources and advocacy it needs to grow exponentially. As one fundraising guide aptly notes, major donors crave involvement and to feel “a vital part of your organization's mission”[afpglobal.org](https://afpglobal.org/crafting-donor-journey-tactics-major-first-time-and-lapsed-donors#:~:text=Construct%20a%20Bespoke%20Experience%3A%20Major,the%20impact%20of%20their%20contributions) – our plan ensures they absolutely do, at every step.
* * *
**Using and Integrating Existing Tools:** Throughout all personas’ journeys, we utilize our current tools (Wix, ClickUp, Slack) to support execution. Wix serves as our public face and member management hub (handling sign-ups, content delivery, and basic CRM for segmentation). ClickUp is our command center for planning and tracking tasks (from scheduling social media posts and email campaigns to reminding us of personal follow-ups for donors). Slack keeps our team coordinated in real-time (e.g. alerting each other when a major donor email comes in, or when a policy contact engages so we can respond swiftly). By relying on these tools we already have in place, we ensure efficiency and consistency without overcomplicating our workflow. The result is a cohesive multi-channel journey for each persona, implemented by a synchronized team.
Each persona’s journey is distinct, but all are interlinked by our core mission and brand values. By executing these detailed journey plans, we will attract and retain academics to drive the research, galvanize a worldwide community of enthusiasts to sustain our efforts, earn the trust of policy makers to legitimize and support our field, and secure major donors to supercharge our initiatives. This holistic approach ensures that **SUAPS’s outreach and growth strategy is personalized yet unified**, ultimately building a thriving ecosystem around UAP studies.

## 8\. SOP for AI Writing Agents
### 🧠 Context First
Before generating content, always confirm or receive:
*   Target audience persona (e.g., Scholar, Supporter, Donor, Policy Maker, Chris Okafor)
*   Platform (LinkedIn, Email, Newsletter, etc.)
*   Content type (Announcement, Blog, Video Script, etc.)
*   Deadline and publishing owner
*   Source links, quotes, and factual references
*   Internal brief or stakeholder notes if available
### 🧬 Archetype Alignment
All content must express SUAPS’s triple-archetype tone:
*   **Sage**: Grounded in verifiable knowledge
*   **Explorer**: Curious and inviting, avoids elitism
*   **Magician**: Transforms confusion into clarity and awe
Every paragraph should carry at least one of those voices. Blending is encouraged.
### ✍️ Output Checklist
For each piece of content, AI must:
*   Use human tone and varied sentence structure
*   Avoid robotic, over-polished phrasing
*   Never use banned filler/adjectives (Section 3, Rule 6–7)
*   Avoid jargon unless followed by a clear explanation
*   Use one active-voice call-to-action with a front-loaded verb
*   If referencing studies or research: include source link or state _“preliminary”_
### 📚 Factual Behavior
If unsure about a claim, the agent should:
*   Respond: “Awaiting clarification on \[X\]; unable to continue without confirmation.”
*   Never hallucinate citations, study results, or organizational capabilities.
*   Reference the Society as **an advisory and support body**, not a direct research group.
### 🧾 Formatting Rules
*   Limit one idea per paragraph
*   Use bullets when listing ≥3 items
*   Keep intros under 60 words unless a blog/article
*   Add headings if output is longer than 200 words
### 🎯 Relevance Filter
Always ask before posting:
*   Is this content consistent with SUAPS’s role as a neutral, scientific convenor?
*   Does this content add clarity to a complex space?
*   Would this be shared by someone who respects science but isn’t already “in the UAP bubble”?

## 8\. Example Micro-Snippets
*   **Tweet**: “Data first, hype never. 👓 Our latest peer-reviewed study on UAP radar signatures just dropped—read the open access summary here → \[link\] #Science #UAP”
*   **Newsletter CTA**: “Ready for deep dives and honest answers? Join 8,000 global supporters giving $4/mo to fund open UAP science.”
*   **Press Quote**: “Unknown does not mean unknowable,” said Dr. Michael Cifone, founder of SUAPS. “With rigorous tools and transparent methods we can separate signal from noise.”
* * *

## 9\. Visual Tone Alignment
*   **Primary Palette**: Midnight Blue #0D1B2A (backgrounds), White #FFFFFF (text), Light Grey #F0F0F0 (UI frames).
*   **Accent**: Gold-Yellow #F5A623 (CTA buttons, key highlights).
*   **Support**: Charcoal #333333, Black #000000; Optional Teal #29ABE2 for charts.
*   **Imagery**: Telescopes, research equipment, scholarly gatherings, archival documents; occasional horizon or starfield for Explorer flair. No stereotypical “flying saucer” graphics.
* * *

## 10\. Continual Evolution
*   Re-evaluate tone and banned-word list every 6 months.
*   Conduct quarterly reader sentiment surveys to refine clarity and trust.
*   Log all major content wins/lessons in ClickUp **Content > Retrospectives**.
> **Remember**: Our credibility is our currency. Each sentence must earn the reader’s trust—through facts, clarity, and respectful curiosity.

# Working With Me Docs

Creating a Working with Me Doc is a great way to benefit you and your team. Here are just a few of the reasons!
1. **Promote transparency** - clearly outlining your working style, preferences, and expectations prevents miscommunications and helps people understand one another on a deeper level.
2. **Encourage efficiency and communication** - when everyone knows how you work best, they can adapt their approach to complement yours, leading to more productive collaborations.
3. **Foster respect** - by sharing your boundaries and needs, you are showing respect for others' time and energy, which can in turn foster mutual respect within the team.
4. **Development yourself** - the process of creating this document requires self-reflection and awareness, which can lead to personal growth and improved working relationships.

While all managers are required to create a Working with Me Doc, we highly encourage that everyone in our company make one! Be as open, honest, and detailed as you'd like

# Quick Tutorial: Using ClickUp for Team Tasks

### Scenario: Assigning a Task to Create a Blog Post
* * *

### 1\. Create a Task
*   Go to your ClickUp, choose the correct workspace and click **\+ New Task**.
*   Choose Task Type
*   Title: “Blog Post - Subject”
*   Add a clear description with instructions and goals. Tip: ClickUp will help you write it.
* * *

### 2\. Set Priority & Due Date
*   Set **Priority** (e.g., High).
*   Set a **Due Date** (e.g., July 31, 2025).
* * *

### 3\. Assign the Task
*   Assign to the responsible person (or multiple people if enabled).
* * *

### 4\. Add Subtasks and Checklists
**Subtasks:**
Use for major steps that need separate status tracking, assignees, or deadlines.
_Examples:_
*   Draft content
*   Design graphics/screenshots
*   Review and approve

**Checklists:**
Use for quick, simple actions that don’t need separate tracking: Done or not Done.
_Examples:_
*   Spellcheck the document
*   Add links to SOP
*   Double-check formatting

**Tip:**
If a step needs its own deadline, and discussion—make it a subtask.
If it’s a quick, minor action—make it a checklist item.
* * *

### 5\. Collaborate & Track Progress
*   Use **Comments** to discuss, ask questions, or tag teammates.
*   Attach files as needed.
*   Move the task through statuses (To Do, In Progress, Complete).
*   Mark as complete when done.
* * *

### Why This Works
*   **Subtasks** = big, trackable steps.
*   **Checklists** = quick reminders.
*   Everything is organized, visible, and actionable for the whole team.
* * *

# Managing Your Workflow in ClickUp

# Overview
Below are some best practices for using ClickUp to manage your work effectively.

## **General ClickUp Usage**
### Best practice

Above all else, keep all of your work tasks in ClickUp, to ensure that everything is easily accessible. In other words, **all work should live in a task**, period. can always move it later.

### How to create a task in ClickUp
There are many options, all detailed [HERE](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6309647350807-Create-a-task).

If you use the "T" hotkey in ClickUp, as illustrated below, ensure that you set a descriptive name, assignee, and due date, before creating a task!
![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/fa391c17-c38c-4e59-ab7d-d24140506192/2023-10-26_12-18-22%20(1).gif)

### R**egularly update your tasks**
Schedule time, every couple of weeks, to go through your tasks and ensure they're up-to-date, respectively. Proactively closing the loop with colleagues and keeping yourself accountable will keep your workflow humming!

* * *
## **Home**
### Best practice

Home in ClickUp is your centralized hub where you can manage all your work without worrying about its location in the Hierarchy. Home shows you everything you need to do and when it needs to be done.

**As long as you are an assignee and the task has a start and/or due date, it will appear on your Home screen.**

To maintain a clean Home screen, make sure to update due dates and avoid letting tasks and reminders fall overdue.

### How to access Home in ClickUp
To access Home, simply click on "Home" located at the top of your left-hand Sidebar.
**_Tip:_** _Press "H" anywhere in your Workspace to go directly to Home!_

To learn more about the various sections of Home, click [HERE](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6308921446935-Home).

You'll notice that Home in Staging looks a bit different! To configure Home however suits your workflow best, click "customize" in the upper right-hand corner of your Home screen to add the cards that display your tasks, Reminders, etc. how you like, as illustrated below.
![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/76f34c7c-3280-43b3-9346-3266c8156c22/2023-10-26_12-27-01%20(1).gif)

### Assigned comments
Assigned comments in ClickUp are a great way to delegate and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. You can view comments that have been assigned to you in your Home.

[HERE](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6311126397591-Assigned-Comments)'s additional information on how to use assigned comments. For example, you can track the progress of comments you've assigned to others in the respective task's activity feed!

* * *
## **Inbox**
### Best practice

There are a few best practices here:
1. **Follow a 24-hour MAX rule of getting back to your colleagues.** Ideally, check and respond appropriately to your notifications 3+ times a day. This helps keep everyone productive and prevents blockers!
2. **Snooze notifications** to prioritize your tasks and avoid distractions.
3. **Aim for "Inbox Zero" by the end of each day.** This means clearing out your Inbox and addressing all pending tasks.
4. **Utilize keyboard shortcuts in Inbox** to quickly navigate or make changes like snoozing notifications. Check out the [**full list**](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/16101057400471-Inbox-settings-and-keyboard-shortcuts#h_01H9QXZJ0VQ9HFD7J8NFNCT70V) of shortcuts you can leverage in Inbox to increase productivity gains.

### How to access Inbox in ClickUp
To access Inbox, simply click on "Inbox" located at the top of your left-hand Sidebar. Once you're in Inbox, you can view, manage and respond to all your tasks and notifications!
**_Tip:_** _Press "I" anywhere in your Workspace to go directly to Inbox! Within a specific notification, press "esc" to get back to Inbox._

To learn more about what you can accomplish from directly within Inbox, click [HERE](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/12724229385623-Intro-to-Inbox).

Customize notifications to fit your personal work style and preferences under ["notification settings"](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6325918957335-Notification-settings), once you've clicked on your avatar in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. This is crucial to keeping your notifications manageable and actionable.

### Establish a 'now, next, later' system in Inbox
When working through your Inbox, use a 'do-it-now, do-it-next, do-it-later' workflow to better prioritize your time.
*   If a response or action item will take less than five minutes to complete, **do it now** and clear the notification.
*   If you can’t clear the notification immediately or in less than five minutes, keep the notification and leave a reaction to indicate that you've seen the message and will look into it or circle back to it soon. Then, **do it next**.
*   Last but not least, if something is more time consuming and is going to require a larger effort, either snooze it or move it to your Tray, as illustrated below. Then, **do it later**, when you have the time!
![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/3b92f33e-309c-40a9-b1b3-cd6ff038e6cd/Inbox.gif)

* * *
## **Reminders**
### Best practice

Setting Reminders helps ensure that important tasks or follow-ups are not forgotten. It allows you to stay organized and meet deadlines effectively.

When setting Reminders, consider the following best practices:
1. Be specific with the Reminder details, including the task or action required.
2. Set Reminders for appropriate dates and times to allow sufficient time for completion.
3. Regularly review and update your Reminders to stay on top of your to-dos.

### How to leverage Reminders in ClickUp
There are many options, all detailed [HERE](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6326047586199-Intro-to-Reminders).

Please note that ClickUp allows you to create stand-alone Reminders using the "R" hotkey, as well as Reminders on specific task and/or Doc comments (mentioned below)!

### Comment Reminders
Set comment Reminders when you need to look into something further before responding to a task, as illustrated below! This is especially important if you are asked to deliver a response.
*   Comment Reminders will appear on your Home screen, making it easy to keep track of tasks that require your attention.
![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/158bbbbd-de1f-4df1-8b54-2aa1efa54e56/Reminders.gif)

* * *
## Favorites
### Best practice

Use the Favorites feature to bookmark key tasks, Docs, Dashboards, etc. that you frequently need to access, so you can access them quickly & easily.

### How to Favorite items in ClickUp
1. Navigate to the item that you want to Favorite.
2. Once you've navigated to the item, look for the star icon usually located at the top right corner of the page. Click on this star icon to add the item to your Favorites.
3. After adding items to your Favorites, you can easily access them from the left-hand Sidebar. Alternatively, "Pin Favorites to top", as illustrated below!
![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/a462f226-0fdb-4825-8ac6-4d87d2ecd8b5/Favorites.gif)

### Tray
While the Favorites feature is designed to save you time by allowing you to bookmark the Workspace locations you use the most, the Tray feature is designed to keep your important items and to-dos top of mind until you're completely done with them. When you don't know what to do next, look to your Tray!

Minimize tasks and/or Docs to your Tray, so you can quickly return to them at any time!
**Bonus #1:** Docked tasks will carry over if you open ClickUp in a new browser tab.
**Bonus #2:** If you minimize or close a task while writing a comment, the comment will be saved as a draft.

* * *
## **Tasks in Multiple Lists (TIML)**
### Best practice

Create a master List for all the tasks you want to keep handy and use the TIML feature to add tasks that live anywhere in ClickUp to your master List.

While you can use this master List as your comprehensive **task** to-do list instead of or in addition to Home, your ClickUp Reminders will only show up in Home.

### How to leverage Tasks in Multiple Lists
To learn how to **TIML**, click [HERE](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6309958824727-Tasks-in-Multiple-Lists).

Create [private views](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6310155254039-Create-a-private-view) to give yourself a sandbox to filter and group data for your own needs, without affecting any public views. You can create private views for any type of view!

### Adding vs. moving tasks
The below gif illustrates how to "Add to another List" or "Add to My List", _then_ how to move a task... pay close attention. 👀
![](https://t333.s.clickup-attachments.com/t333/7937ec64-87e5-4026-88b4-ef29d1d804f6/TIML.gif)

# SOPs



# Communication SOP

### 1 Purpose
You will know exactly where to talk, how fast to reply, and when to turn words into action. It should cut wait time and make ownership clear. One set of rules for where we talk, how fast we answer, and who owns the next move.
### 2 Scope
Applies to all staff, volunteers, contractors, and Board members.
### 3 Roles

| Role | What you do |
| ---| --- |
| Sender | Pick the right channel, set the correct _Priority (listed below)_, add “what + why + by-when.” |
| Receiver | Acknowledge, act, or redirect inside the response window. |
| Team Lead | Watch the Priority dashboard, coach slow responders. |
| Ops Director | Keep this doc current; review quarterly. |

### 4 Channels to be used

| Channel | Use for | Don’t use for |
| ---| ---| --- |
| ClickUp Task | Any action item, owner, due date, files | Brainstorming |
| ClickUp Comment / Chat | Decisions, tagged Qs about that task | Long debates |
| Slack | Quick questions, coordination, social chat | Assigning / tracking work |
| Email | External partners, legal, donor comms | Internal approvals |
| Meetings / Huddles | Live problem-solving | Pure status updates (record instead) |

# Rule: if action is needed, create or link a ClickUp task.

### 5 Response windows (Service-Level Expectations)
Use ClickUp’s built-in Priority field—Urgent, High, Normal, Low.

| Priority | When to choose it | Acknowledge | Full reply |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Urgent (red) | Live incident, funding or legal deadline ≤ 48 h | 2 h | 6 h |
| High (orange) | Milestone due within 7 days | 6 h | 24 h |
| Normal (blue) | Routine planned work | 24 h | 72 h |
| Low (grey) | Someday / backlog | 72 h | 5 business days |

**Default is Normal. Sender must state the reason for any bump.**

### 6 Standard flow
1. Draft clear ask → pick channel → set Priority.
2. Create / link the ClickUp task; tag the owner.
3. Owner meets the response window or flags a block.
4. Close the task only when the _definition-of-done_ is met.
5. Archive Slack threads and channels inactive 30 days.
### 7 Escalation
1. No reply after window + 50 % → ping owner once.
2. +1 business day → escalate to their lead in ClickUp.
3. Still stuck → Ops Director steps in.

## **Preamble: Why Prescriptive Structure Matters in UAP Research**
SUAPS embraces a structured, prescriptive project lifecycle for a simple reason: credibility in the UAP field demands it. Historically, UAP research has been fragmented, anecdotal, and poorly integrated with broader scientific norms. As SUAPS seeks to elevate UAP Studies into a respected interdisciplinary field, it draws inspiration from proven models like ESA's ECSS and NASA’s lifecycle protocols.

Three principles guide this approach:
1. **Field Legitimacy**: A well-defined lifecycle provides clarity, consistency, and reproducibility—qualities essential for trust among scientists, donors, and the public.
2. **Speculativeness-Stringency Principle**: The more speculative the proposal, the more stringent the lifecycle adherence required. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary rigor.
3. **Tailored Flexibility**: While the SRLB is prescriptive in form, it allows project-specific tailoring with documented approvals, enabling creativity without sacrificing structure.
By formalizing project phases, review gates, and integration mandates, SUAPS signals its readiness to steward UAP research at a world-class level.
## **1\. Introduction**
This baseline document defines a seven-phase project management approach for all SUAPS-affiliated research projects investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). It ensures alignment with funding protocols, operational milestones, and institutional knowledge integration. The model is flexible enough to accommodate both academic-style research and entrepreneurial ventures with commercial potential.
Key objectives include:
*   Ensure consistency across all portfolio.
*   Provide a clear lifecycle from initial concept through project closeout.
*   Incorporate a Research Readiness Level (RRL) scale to track the maturity of research activities.
**Note:** This document does **not** prescribe how each step must be performed (the “how” can vary), but rather **what** major phases, reviews, and requirements are expected at each stage.

* * *
## **2\. Scope & Applicability**
*   **Scope**: Applies to externally funded research initiatives under AURA initiative focusing on various anomalous phenomena (aerial, underwater, lights, etc.).
*   **Applicability**: To all research-focused organizations that require a structured approach, from contract signings to final data release.
*   **Exclusions**: Extremely small, low‑budget projects (< $5k) may merge or skip certain phases, subject to documented approval.

* * *
## **3\. Seven‑Phase Lifecycle Overview**
Research projects under a DDRG are divided into seven major phases, each culminating in a review or go/no‑go milestone. This helps ensure effective planning, risk control, and alignment with donor expectations.
### **3.1 Phase 0 – Mission / Needs Identification**
**Goal**: Researchers pursue exploratory UAP studies generating proposals for inclusion in the _Integrated Research Portfolio_.

_Key outputs_: Proposal submissions; internal feedback; inclusion in **Research Portfolio Master Dossier**

**Typical Activities**:
*   Early assessment of research scope, preliminary timeline, rough budget.
*   Discussions with potential research teams to gauge feasibility.
*   If relevant, define an initial target **RRL** (see Section 4) or where the project’s knowledge currently stands.

**Deliverable**:
*   **Mission Concept Document** outlining the high‑level problem, goals, and potential approach.
**GO/NO GO**:
*   **Mission Definition Review (MDR)**: Confirms that the concept aligns with scientific and organizational priorities.
### **3.2 Phase 1 –** Feasibility and Preliminary Definition
**Goal**: Conduct a feasibility study to evaluate how viable the project is from scientific, financial, and operational standpoints. Create a preliminary research requirements framework and outline instrumentation scope.

**Typical Activities**:
*   Estimate resources, potential risks, and synergy with existing research.
*   Refine cost and schedule projections, identify possible partnerships.
*   Expand on the RRL: if research is at a low RRL (concept stage), identify steps to advance it.
*   Conduct preliminary site visits or archival data analysis (old case files, relevant logs).
*   Identify needed instrumentation or sensor arrays for initial observation.
*   Assess risk factors, from funding to field safety.
*   Draft a **Project Research Plan (PRP)** specifying target phenomenon(s), minimal data capture standards, instrumentation, timeline and success criteria.
*   Engage with experts to validate approach (e.g., data science, lab resources, field logistics)

**Deliverable**:
*   **Preliminary Project Research Plan (PRP)** including high‑level method, potential site visits (if any), updated budget estimate and outlining scope, success criteria, and resource breakdown.

**GO/NO GO**:
*   **System Requirements Review (SRR)**: Verifies the clarity of objectives and the readiness to move into a detailed planning/design phase.
### **3.3 Phase 2 –** Detailed Definition and Funding Alignment
**Goal**: Lock in the detailed plan (instrumentation, scientific frame, schedule, budget, staffing) for the main research effort and allocate budget, either SUAPs or donor.

**Typical Activities**:
*   Develop a **Detailed Research Protocol** addressing how phenomena will be captured or measured (e.g., IR cameras, environmental sensors, poltergeist trigger monitoring).
*   Align on final timeline and intermediate deliverables
*   Align and allocate budget.
*   Sign agreements with donor (if any) and SUAPS
*   Prepare WBS and risk assessment
*   Provide a clear scientific framing of the project, which details and explains the methodological foundations of the project in relation to similar projects.

**Deliverable**:
*   **Detailed Project Research Plan (PRP)**, including:
    *   Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
    *   Verification & validation approach for data
    *   Communication plan (reporting to donors)
    *   Contingency measures for schedule or budget overrun
*   **Scientific Methodology**
    *   A methods paper should be prepared, especially if the project is significantly inter- or cross-disciplinary

**GO/ NO GOT**:
*   **Critical Design Review (CDR)**: Baselines the official plan, authorizes the project to proceed with main research tasks and major spending.
### **3.4 Phase 3 – Pre-Execution**
**Goal**: Ensure all logistical, technical, and operational components are secured and ready for successful execution of the core research phase.

**Activities**:
*   Finalize procurement of required equipment (leased or purchased), software licenses, and tools.
*   Confirm availability and delivery timeline for all research instruments.
*   Prepare logistics for field operations, including travel, lodging, shipping, and on-site coordination (if applicable).
*   Test core systems, tools, and connectivity setups (e.g., live data relay, backups).
*   Validate permits, insurance, and legal compliance where necessary.

**Deliverable**:
*       *   Finalized and approved procurement list
    *   Deployment logistics checklist
    *   Live **Budget Tracking Sheet**, including disbursements and contingency allocation

**GO/NO GO**:
Approval by the **Project Manager** (PM) based on verified readiness of all critical systems, logistics, and risk mitigations.
### **3.5 Phase 4 – Core Research Execution (Qualification & Production)**
**Goal**: Execute the core research tasks, data collection, initial analysis, and partial verification. “Qualification & Production” parallels building or qualifying a product in engineering; here, it’s about gathering raw data and confirming the methodology works.

**Typical Activities**:
*   Perform experiments, field expeditions, or lab work.
*   Conduct partial data analysis, ensuring instruments and methods yield reliable results.
*   Possibly move from RRL 3–4 (concept validation) up to RRL 5–6 (substantial demonstration in a relevant environment).

**Deliverable**:
*   **Interim Data Packages** or “System Verification & Validation” updates.
*   Proof that research methodology is robust and that you can proceed to full analysis.

**GO/NO GO**:
*   **Verification Readiness Review (VRR)**: Confirms the project’s readiness to integrate and validate all components (field or lab resources).
*   **Verification Review (VR)**: Assesses the outcomes of partial data analyses or trials.

### **3.6 Phase 5 – Utilization**
**Goal**: Fully utilize and finalize the research analysis, interpret results, and produce the main deliverables (papers, prototypes, or documented findings).

**Typical Activities**:
*   Conduct deeper data analysis, including multi-disciplinary reviews (e.g., geophysics, atmospheric experts, psychologists).
*   Validate results against the original success criteria.
*   If relevant, present or publish findings (e.g., journal articles, public repository).

 **Deliverable**:
*   **Final Research Outcomes** (reports, publications, dataset).
*   Possibly achieving RRL 7–8 if the findings are proven in a real or operational environment.

**GO/NO GO**:
*   **Research Utilization Review**: Confirms the data is complete, validated, and ready for distribution or practical use.

### **3.7 Phase 6 –** **Integration / Closeout**
**Goal**: Officially conclude the project and handle archiving, final reporting, and institutional integration of knowledge. SUAPS introduces two levels of integration:

*   **First-order (Within-project):** PIs must synthesize the project’s conceptual components into a coherent framework that reflects methodological consistency and thematic clarity.
*   **Second-order (Cross-project):** SUAPS conducts institutional synthesis across all completed projects. This is where new knowledge may emerge from comparative analysis, thematic convergence, or theoretical extrapolation.
    *   **PI Engagement Opportunity:** PIs may be invited to participate in this process through stipends or joint working groups. Outputs may support publications, education, outreach, or AI-integrated research platforms.
    *   **Community Ecosystem Integration:** Findings from Phase 6 may directly feed into SUAPS's broader "Community Interest Ecosystem" (CIE) including citizen science, forums, curricula, and public events

**Typical Activities**:
*   **Financial close‑out** (final cost reconciliation).
*   Store or dispose of specialized equipment/instruments.
*   Final donor reporting, lessons learned, record retention.
*   Knowledge integration

**Deliverable**:
*   **Closeout Report**, including final financial statement, RRL achieved, lessons learned and best practices for future projects.
*   **First Order Report**

**Review**:
*   **Closeout Confirmation**: A formal sign‑off that all deliverables are accepted and the project is officially concluded

* * *
## **4\. UAP Research Readiness Level (RRL) Framework**
### **4.1 RRL Scale**
**RRL 1 – Anecdotal Baseline**
*   Evidence relies on eyewitness accounts, historical or anecdotal reports describing unusual events (e.g., poltergeist disturbances, unidentified lights, mysterious sounds).
*   Hypothesis is predominantly conceptual; minimal or no specialized instrumentation used to gather data.
*   Research focuses on collating firsthand narratives and unverified leads to determine potential areas of inquiry.

**RRL 2 – Historical Analysis & Early Categorization**
*   Investigation expands into archival data (e.g., old case files, audio recordings, relevant interviews, radar or seismic logs, if applicable).
*   Emerging categorization of phenomena (e.g., poltergeist activity, non-aerial anomalies, submersible “USO” events, or more conventional “UFO” sightings).
*   Preliminary plan formed for instrumentation or field approaches to capture more objective evidence.

**RRL 3 – Basic Instrumentation & Pilot Data Capture**
*   Introduction of basic sensor systems (still/video cameras, audio/EM detectors, motion-activated devices, environmental sensors) in controlled or semi-controlled scenarios.
*   Potential field or lab pilot tests yield initial objective data, though coverage may be sparse or opportunistic.
*   Early attempts to standardize how the phenomenon is recorded, culminating in partial success capturing actual anomalous data.

**RRL 4 – Multi‑Sensor Evidence & Correlation**
*   At least one significant episode is captured with multiple sensors or vantage points (audio, video, environmental changes, witness accounts, etc.).
*   Preliminary data analysis suggests the anomaly cannot be readily attributed to common misidentifications.
*   A structured protocol emerges for collecting and correlating sensor outputs across different forms of phenomena (e.g., “electromagnetic disruptions + strange visuals + physical object interaction”).

**RRL 5 – Recurrent Detection & Pattern Identification**
*   **Multiple documented events** exhibit consistent signatures or patterns (e.g., distinct EM spikes coinciding with orbs occurrences or recurring underwater anomalies).
*   Data-gathering protocols show repeatability of methods—though the phenomenon itself remains spontaneous, the instrumentation approach yields coherent, comparable datasets.
*   More robust hypotheses form around repeated observation, even if the underlying causes remain elusive.

**RRL 6 – Extended Dataset & Sophisticated Analysis**
*   A larger body of systematically collected data using enhanced or specialized instrumentation (multi-spectrum imaging, environment sensors, extended audio arrays).
*   Analytical techniques (e.g., advanced signal processing, machine learning classifiers) begin revealing deeper patterns or correlation with environmental factors (geomagnetic data, weather, times of day/year).
*   Preliminary external or peer commentary—though not necessarily consensus—confirms the data’s quality and broad significance.

**RRL 7 – Systematic Deployment & Cross‑Context Verification**
*   Long-term, multi-site observation networks or a well-established routine of sensor deployments record recurring anomalies in diverse environments (homes, remote fields, underwater, etc.).
*   Convergence of multiple lines of evidence across different teams or specialized domains (e.g., geophysics, atmospheric science, parapsychology).
*   Hypotheses become increasingly refined, providing partial explanatory frameworks for repeated anomalies.

**RRL 8 – Community Scrutiny & Cross‑Validation**
*   Data sets face external scrutiny from various expert communities—technical analysts, domain specialists (e.g., oceanographers, physicists, psychologists).
*   Collaborative comparisons with other anomaly research databases lead to broader acceptance that the data is at least robust, even if still unexplained.
*   Emergent consensus on certain classification schemes or recommended measurement protocols for future research.

**RRL 9 – Mature Characterization & Established Methodology**
*   A widely recognized methodological playbook exists for investigating and documenting a broad range of anomalous phenomena (standard sensor setups, validated data-handling procedures).
*   Core findings and investigative frameworks are accepted as credible within specialized UAP research circles; skepticism remains in mainstream science, but the data collection and analysis process is recognized as professional.
*   Work shifts from basic detection/validation to refining deeper theories of cause or nature, focusing on integrating cross-disciplinary insights (e.g., the role of consciousness, advanced physics, or environmental triggers).
### **4.2 Tailoring RRL for Specific Phenomena**
Researchers may focus on only a subset of these levels. For instance, a new poltergeist study might start at RRL 1 or 2 (archival/spontaneous reports) and aim for RRL 4 or 5 (multi-sensor capture) within a single year.

* * *
## **5\. Roles & Responsibilities**
*   **Donor/SUAPS CEO**: Initiates or approves mission funding; may define research priorities and expected outcomes.
*   **Director of Operations or PM**: Oversees project lifecycle across Phases 0–6; manages deliverable reviews, phase gates, and operational execution.
*   **Principal Investigator (PI)** or **Research Lead**: Leads day-to-day scientific work; accountable for research integrity, analysis methodology, and team coordination.
*   **CFO**: Manages grant disbursements, oversees compliance (AML, cross-border transfers), and maintains restricted accounts.
*   **CEO: Final approver**
*   **Support Staff**: Includes logistics coordinators, instrumentation specialists, data engineers, and archival/documentation support.
*   **Advisory Board Members:** Provide subject-matter guidance and assist with proposal evaluation and methodology vetting

* * *
## **6\. Core Processes**
### **6.1 Planning & Contracting**
1. **Grant Agreement**: Defines total budget, timeline, RRL targets, overhead, and reference to the 7-phase framework.
2. **Research Recipient Agreement**: Outlines responsibilities, milestones, data handling requirements, and acceptance of the RRL framework.
3. **Tailoring**: Project scale or maturity may warrant merging or skipping phases; tailoring decisions must be documented.
### **6.2 Financial Management & Compliance**
1. **Restricted Account**: Research funds must remain separate from operational or general-purpose accounts.
2. **Disbursement Schedule**: May be tied to each phase or sub-phase (e.g., partial funding released at end of Phase 1, another portion at Phase 3).
3. **Reporting & Audits**: Larger grants may need external financial reviews near Phase 5 or 6.
### **6.3 Risk Management**
1. **Risk Register**: Initiated in Phase 0 or 1, updated at each phase review (0–6).
2. **Mitigation Strategies**: Especially relevant for field work hazards, data corruption, or cross-border constraints.
3. **Contingency Budget**: If recommended by the donor or internal policy, set aside funds for risk response
### **6.4 Reviews & Deliverables per Phase** 
*   **Phase 0** – Mission Definition Review (MDR) / Mission Concept Document, Portfolio Dossier Entry
*   **Phase 1** – System Requirements Review (SRR) / Preliminary Project Research Plan (PRP)
*   **Phase 2** – Critical Design Review (CDR) / Detailed Project Research Plan (PRP)
*   **Phase 3** – Approval from DoO / Procurement list
*   **Phase 4** – Verification Readiness/Verification Review (VRR/VR) / Interim Data Packages or “System Verification & Validation” updates / Proof of methodology.
*   **Phase 5** – Operational Readiness/Research Utilization Review (ORR) / Final Research Outcomes
*   **Phase 6** – Closeout Confirmation / Closeout Report
### **6.5 Tailoring Provisions**
1. **Scale by Grant Size**
*   Small (< $50K): Possibly merge Phases 1 & 2 if the project is straightforward.
*   Medium ($50K–$200K): Standard approach, all phases with simpler reviews.
*   Major ($200K+): Full detail, potentially adding sub‑reviews or more frequent risk checks.

1. **RRL Steps**: If the phenomenon is already at a mid-range RRL (e.g., 4 or 5), the project can skip early RRL steps.
2. **Non-Aerial Phenomena**: The same lifecycle applies whether events are poltergeist in nature, underwater, or atmospheric—only instrumentation specifics and data protocols vary.

* * *
## **7\. Annexes & Templates (to be completed)**
*   **Annex A**: **Sample RRL Extended Descriptions for UAP** (underwater anomalies, ephemeral aerial sightings).
*   **Annex B: Templates** (Grant Agreement template, Phase Review checklists, Risk Register format).
*   **Annex C: Glossary** (Defines key terms like “feasibility,” “preliminary definition,” etc., in the context of our organization).

* * *
# **Implementation Notes**
1. **Implementation**: Each newly funded research project should create a short “Project‑Specific Management Plan” referencing these seven phases, the RRL scale, and required reviews.
2. **Updates**: This baseline document should be revisited periodically to incorporate lessons learned and new best practices.
3. **Donor Communication**: Even if a donor only wants high‑level updates, it is recommended that you keep internal records for each phase’s deliverables and reviews.
4. **Avoid Overcomplication**: If some phases are obviously irrelevant (e.g., “Disposal” for an intangible project), they can be merged or omitted—but the rationale should be documented as part of the tailoring exercise.

**Final Handoff**: Phase 6 includes delivering final data (videos, sensor logs, analyses), storing them in a secure archival repository, and concluding financial obligations.

# Course Creation Tutorial

All participants must register for the event through the Society’s official registration process. Registration fees (where applicable) are non-refundable unless the event is canceled by the Organizers.

4\. Participant Eligibility:
Unless otherwise noted, participation is open to individuals with an interest in the topic of the event. The Organizers reserve the right to _deny participation_ to any individual without providing a specific reason. Some events are closed to everyone _except_ members of the Society (see relevant event details), and therefore registration will be correspondingly limited to those with active Society memberships. Otherwise, Society events are open for registration to the general public at large pursuant to the Terms & Conditions listed elsewhere herein.

5\. Program Changes:
The Organizers may make changes to the event program, including speakers and topics, if necessary. Every effort will be made to notify registered participants of such changes in a timely manner.

6\. Intellectual Property & Recording of the Event:
All intellectual property rights associated with the event, including but not limited to presentations, materials, and discussions, belong to the respective presenters _and also_ to the Society. Participants and anyone within the event space at any time _may not_ record or reproduce any part of the event without explicit permission. The Society itself may be recording some or all of the event using the online platform wherein the event takes place; it also therefore reserves the right to use this recorded content _at its discretion_ – subject to applicable laws and other regulations that legally supersede these Terms & Conditions.

**_Note:_** _by reading and agreeing to these Terms & Conditions, you acknowledge and fully accept to give your consent for the recording of the event, if the event will be recorded, and that any ensuing recorded content be used at the sole discretion of the Society (e.g. it can be made available both on the Society’s official website, and through its official YouTube channel), subject to the Society's own internal policies regarding the recording and subsequent distribution of Society-produced content.

### Details
*   **Meeting Start and Michael's Absence** Rafael Di Carlantonio began the meeting, noting that Michael Glawson is on vacation in Thailand. Michael had asked Rafael to lead the meeting and discuss the research initiative he had briefly mentioned previously ([00:00:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.kc7t6xicd9h8)).
*   **Esteban Corio's Updates** Esteban Corio provided updates on potential collaborations in Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico, they are in initial conversations with SIMix, who sent a collaboration proposal translated and sent to Michael for review ([00:00:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.kc7t6xicd9h8)). Regarding Brazil, they are awaiting feedback on formalizing the profession of euphology after governmental approval. Esteban also mentioned attending the EUO convention in Argentina to network with other organizations ([00:03:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.wy6ig5vjam62)).
*   **Brazil's Euphology Profession and Roberto's Absence** Rafael Di Carlantonio noted that while euphology became an official profession in Brazil, it was categorized as esoteric, requiring further work to shift it to a scientific category. Rafael also mentioned Roberto not contacting them after a previous call, with Esteban explaining Roberto was on vacation ([00:05:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.mt8lp2ca98pu)).
*   **Researcher Information Request** Michael Glawson inquired with Esteban Corio about accessing profiles or CVs of individuals leading research components, particularly in Mexico. Esteban agreed to obtain this information for Michael ([00:05:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.hpztm7ag0gbm)).
*   **Strategic Plan for Research Portfolio Initiative** Rafael Di Carlantonio presented the strategic plan for the research portfolio development initiative, building upon the Donor Directed Research Grant (DDRG) framework outlined in Michael's memo. The presentation covered what DDRG is, the addition of phase zero, and how this integrates with outreach and funding growth to enhance the society's impact and credibility ([00:07:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.hgyubq20omla)).
*   **Context and Vision for Research Portfolio** Rafael Di Carlantonio explained that Michael's memo in April called for an open call for research proposals to create an integrated portfolio. This portfolio aims to be a unified collection of high-quality research projects demonstrating scientific rigor in the UAP field, suitable for pitching to donors, crowdfunding, and partners. The goal is to scale up research, increase legitimacy, and improve public and donor engagement ([00:09:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.1xadk8yl1tl0)).
*   **Donor Directed Research Grant (DDRG) Framework** Rafael Di Carlantonio detailed the DDRG framework, a seven-phase project management approach modeled after high-end industries like the European Space Agency ([00:09:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.1xadk8yl1tl0)). Each phase has specific goals and gate reviews to ensure projects remain on track, starting with confirming visibility and ending with project closeout. This structured approach aims to give donors confidence and provide researchers with a clear roadmap ([00:10:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.h0hf8hsl5yrm)).
*   **Addition of Phase Zero** Rafael Di Carlantonio highlighted the enhancement to the DDRG with the addition of phase zero, which serves as a research idea and engagement generator ([00:10:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.h0hf8hsl5yrm)). Unlike the original framework where projects typically began after donor onboarding, phase zero captures and shapes raw ideas before funding is involved. This funnel approach intends to improve project quality and scalability by cultivating multiple ideas in parallel ([00:12:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.l0tcj15w6lt)).
*   **Phase Zero Details and Goals** Rafael Di Carlantonio elaborated on phase zero as an independent exploratory research phase where ideas can be generated without initial funding. The society aims to incentivize creativity by inviting scientists, scholars, and potentially patrons to propose projects. The research program team, to be led by Peter Sforza, will review, provide feedback, and offer support to refine these ideas ([00:13:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.2qqxfcgs63q3)). This process ensures high-quality, mission-focused proposals are ready when engaging donors or considering crowdfunding ([00:14:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.in4v6ewx1nqi)).
*   **Integration of Research, Outreach, and Funding** Rafael Di Carlantonio emphasized the crucial integration of the research pipeline with outreach and funding strategies ([00:17:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.ogb858cv2ix0)). Phase zero is not only a research step but also an opportunity for marketing and community building by involving supporters in the proposal development journey through updates like blog posts and videos. A ready portfolio allows for offering donors a tangible menu of vetted projects ([00:19:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.w64eqwvbeeny)). Successful projects moving through the DDRG phases will generate public enthusiasm, attracting more donors and researchers ([00:20:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.esrtnsot0k3i)).
*   **Implementation Timeline for Phase Zero** Rafael Di Carlantonio outlined an ambitious timeline to launch phase zero, starting in Q2 with laying the groundwork, setting up the team and tools, and informing researchers ([00:20:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.esrtnsot0k3i)). Q3 will focus on maintaining momentum, with a midpoint live streaming of ideas in August, while preparing for review after the October 1st submission deadline ([00:21:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.7w8tf6ioexo4)). The goal is to leverage the submission announcement to garner publicity and donor attention ([00:22:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.cl6qpr5gbsgi)).
*   **Impact of the Research Portfolio Initiative** Rafael Di Carlantonio discussed the anticipated internal impact, including a constant production of high-quality research projects providing redundancy and variety ([00:23:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.kdlu3rqh2ibk)). Externally, the society will be seen as highly professional and efficient, leading to increased and faster funding as donors can choose from a menu of projects ([00:25:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.wikop0ajxkfv)). The initiative also serves as marketing by sharing real scientific excitement, building public trust and enthusiasm, and attracting more researchers and partners ([00:26:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.4yagyx3uod2i)). Ultimately, the society aims to become known as the central place for serious UAP research, creating a sustainable model for growth ([00:27:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.44yax8ofmvho)).
*   **Call for Buy-in and Support** Rafael Di Carlantonio concluded by emphasizing that the research portfolio initiative could be a culture shift for the society's approach to research ([00:27:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.44yax8ofmvho)). They requested the directors' buy-in and active support, including endorsing and contributing to the plan, as well as being ambassadors for this vision. With the heavy lifting outlined, execution can begin upon final approval ([00:28:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.l6h49m33ntzi)).
*   **Market Research and Uniqueness of the Initiative** David Metcalfe added that this initiative would be groundbreaking and the only one of its kind in the UAP space, even compared to established organizations like the Institute of Noetic Sciences ([00:28:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.l6h49m33ntzi)). David stressed the need for director buy-in to build the network from the grassroots level ([00:29:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.vmkf7pxcv2nv)). He noted the low follower metrics of competitor organizations on LinkedIn, highlighting the new space the society is entering ([00:31:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.py15zfvfgqb2)).
*   **Marketing Needs and Challenges** David Metcalfe discussed current marketing efforts, including LinkedIn and Twitter profiles, suggesting the latter could be re-aimed towards the society ([00:31:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.py15zfvfgqb2)). He pointed out the lack of an Instagram and Facebook presence, which need to be established. David also emphasized the need for a creative media team of volunteers, as high-level producers require payment ([00:32:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.t3bmnvxtng8z)). He suggested leveraging existing YouTube content for shorts on other platforms ([00:34:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.jtdg2bng2p4m)).
*   **Partnerships and Collaborations** David Metcalfe raised the idea of partnering with existing incubators and idea accelerators at universities to bolster the initiative's profile ([00:14:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.in4v6ewx1nqi)) ([00:35:33](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.aro0htzg23vl)). He suggested considering collaborations beyond peer organizations, such as with NASA's innovation ecosystem ([00:36:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.4z53t4ipa5w1)). David also mentioned Deep Prasad's hackathon as an example, while noting potential reputational risks associated with certain partners ([00:37:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.5by90q9ut7i6)).
*   **Learning from Other Initiatives** David Metcalfe highlighted the problematic public funding rollout by SOUL, cautioning against tasteless offers to donors and emphasizing the expectation for inclusive engagement ([00:39:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.l1ax5gk7v5pv)). This provided a lesson learned for the society's own initiative ([00:39:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.7fo3x897i82l)).
*   **Media Team and Content Creation** Rafael Di Carlantonio acknowledged the need for a media team to move forward with marketing ideas, stating it is already in the plans to hire more people for content creation. He suggested exploring paid short-term engagements with media professionals. David reiterated that while volunteers could contribute, moving quickly is necessary ([00:40:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.cuzajijvftuw)). He cautioned against marketing approaches seen as grifting in the UAP space ([00:41:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.8cs01g8x02eg)).
*   **Proposal Volume Expectations** Michael Glawson inquired about the expected number of proposals needed for the cycle to be perpetual ([00:42:10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.y78kliwgcqeh)). Rafael Di Carlantonio admitted uncertainty, and Peter Sforza raised questions about attracting serious researchers versus public interest in proposals ([00:43:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.u58fu0pk7j5)). Peter also questioned the potential size and scope of proposals ([00:44:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.xdux48yy58tf)).
*   **Target Proposal Numbers and Existing Initiatives** Peter Sforza initially thought a target of 30 proposals, but after Rafael's presentation, considered the potential for more, even a thousand globally. Rafael clarified that 10 really good proposals that could attract donor funding would be satisfactory ([00:45:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.k3422f7k6pgu)). David Metcalfe mentioned existing initiatives like the Baltic Sea Anomaly expedition and sensor array development by groups like UAPx and others, suggesting bringing these into the fold ([00:45:56](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.8xggx1l1o0ae)).
*   **Uniqueness of the Society's Approach** Rafael Di Carlantonio and Michael Glawson affirmed that no other organization seems to be undertaking a similar initiative ([00:47:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.3dmf2pt5k7mm)).
*   **Refining Proposal Submission Process** Michael Glawson suggested considering a two-step proposal process, starting with research questions and notes on methods to lower the barrier to entry ([00:47:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.3dmf2pt5k7mm)). Rafael Di Carlantonio supported this idea, outlining a minimum requirement first step followed by a more elaborated second phase within phase zero ([00:48:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.f4oyckva1lg)).
*   **Template and Subject Limitations for Proposals** Esteban Corio inquired about a proposal template and limitations on research subjects. Rafael Di Carlantonio confirmed a template is being developed. Regarding subject limitations, Rafael expressed a desire to incentivize creativity and be open to everything, aligning with the society's inclusive ethos ([00:50:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.iojodqkhd69k)). Peter Sforza added the need for policies around institutional review and ethics ([00:51:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.oo1b4mvejwu9)).
*   **Defining UAP Studies** Peter Sforza and Michael Glawson discussed the need to define the scope of UAP studies to guide proposals, balancing broadness with the need for focus and productive research ([00:51:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.oo1b4mvejwu9)). Michael suggested potentially defining lanes of proposals, such as humanities, hard sciences, or psychosocial research ([00:54:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.p29p5xhgft5u)).
*   **Examples of UAP Research and Scope** Esteban Corio provided an example of a controversial historical UAP case in Brazil involving alleged interbreeding, questioning its potential fit ([00:53:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.7c9t1s9fuqql)). Rafael Di Carlantonio referenced historical texts like the Bible as potential historical data points ([00:54:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.p29p5xhgft5u)).
*   **Proposal Criteria and Rigor** Peter Sforza emphasized the importance of rigorous criteria, including good hypotheses and methods, while remaining open ([00:55:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.wiage6g5hz69)). He mentioned Mike Sofone's memo which defined sample research domains like phenomenology, theoretical models, and experiential studies. Peter suggested the criteria should tie back to how the research contributes to UAP studies as envisioned by the society ([00:56:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.j3l50vlujux5)).
*   **Potential Donors and Funding Strategy** Esteban Corio asked if donors could include companies or governmental agencies. Rafael Di Carlantonio mentioned needing to consult the legal department regarding government funding. Rafael reiterated the primary goal is for the society to have enough funds to support projects, with donor engagement as a secondary step and crowdfunding as a third ([00:57:40](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.bi2aamtzw0zo)).
*   **Funding and Scientific Freedom** Rafael Di Carlantonio stated openness to various funding sources as long as money flows and projects run. Esteban Corio emphasized the importance of public knowledge of research results when dealing with governmental agencies. Rafael Di Carlantonio stressed the need for funding not to interfere with scientific liberty ([00:58:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.oztqjeb874l8)) ([01:00:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.thkkmu7oso1s)).
*   **Government Interaction and Organizational Identity** Michael Glawson raised concerns about becoming an arm of the government if directly engaging in their research, suggesting it could fundamentally change the organization's nature ([00:58:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.oztqjeb874l8)). They proposed a potential need for a secondary, sister organization in that scenario. Peter Sforza mentioned a white paper from Carl Nell discussing government claiming eminent domain over recovered materials and a potential mechanism for compensation ([00:59:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.8f7gbutp245g)).

They also warned about the possibility of the organization inadvertently becoming a cover for undisclosed research by other entities ([01:03:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.oz6zp359iag4)). David Metcalfe stressed the importance of caution and awareness of geopolitical factors influencing the research sphere ([01:06:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.f8v205hn0m4u)).
*   **Balancing Research Focus and Public Perception** Michael Glawson pointed out the challenge of balancing research into more fringe topics with maintaining credibility among serious researchers. They suggested that accommodating the "goofy fringe" might disincentivize serious researchers and vice versa ([01:04:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.xsj1rd0g3w9)). Peter Sforza suggested that the society's existing academic grounding could help set a standard for research ([01:06:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.f8v205hn0m4u)).
*   **Podcast and Outreach Initiatives** David Metcalfe noted the current society podcast and the need for a more general-facing podcast for phase zero ([01:07:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.x6303pu0mrrz)). Peter Sforza suggested the possibility of research seminars or discussions to generate interest in phase zero proposals ([01:09:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.fecpjwvtaldt)). David Metcalfe proposed Leslie Keane as a potential host to launch a more general podcast ([01:08:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.tkh9cwcu6oko)).
*   **Analysis of Peer Organizations** Peter Sforza expressed curiosity about the organization and focus of peer and competitor organizations like Soul Foundation and SCU ([01:09:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.fecpjwvtaldt)). They noted that some groups seem hyper-focused, while others like Soul Foundation might be making missteps ([01:10:33](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.c8h1r8rwo17b)). David Metcalfe described SCEU as a close peer and potential partner, while Soul Foundation is seen more as a friendly competitor operating differently ([01:12:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.81460ycyxyiq)).
*   **Potential Collaboration with SCU** Esteban Corio suggested Peter Riali and Sarah Little at SCU as potential contact points for initial conversations about collaboration and synergy. David Metcalfe agreed this was a good idea, noting existing connections with SCU leadership. They also mentioned the value of conducting initial market research to understand the existing landscape ([01:14:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.v25gev1tpjt7)).
*   **Defining Organizational Competition** Rafael Di Carlantonio stated they do not see the organization as a business with competitors but rather as having collaborators. Peter Sforza countered that there is competition for attention, especially with groups like Soul Foundation seeking an elite status ([01:17:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.ldsyfnoh7w4x)). Michael Glawson suggested the primary competition lies in framing the issue, with different organizations emphasizing different aspects like policy, physics, or broad research exploration ([01:18:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.m14p0k1ckjxe)).
*   **Phase Zero Development and Progress** Rafael Di Carlantonio indicated the presentation and work done were a great development. David Metcalfe commended the level of development and clarity of the document, noting that the goals are in process and now require fleshing out. They thanked Rafael Di Carlantonio and Michael Glawson for their efforts ([01:19:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkR11B0tAkbONT937C5oSxK0sfi8CtKN64j0MiQU99Q/edit?tab=t.ue3dsy1afgpe#heading=h.gpza3vux8dfh)).

*   **Outreach Explanation** Rafael Di Carlantonio asked Esteban Corio about the role of outreach within the society. Esteban explained that outreach initially focused on promoting educational offerings globally ([00:17:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.m6q9q22izmpq)). The role is evolving to include identifying potential franchising institutions and qualified researchers ([00:18:53](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.ovwokdaowlcg)).
*   **Market Analysis and Press Presence** David Metcalfe shared a preliminary market analysis using chat GPT, noting that the society appears less robust online than it actually is ([00:20:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.e7st8antb52k)). This highlighted the need for a stronger press presence and more mentions from other groups. David is working with Brian Anslinger to develop a strategy for media outreach, especially around conferences and relevant events ([00:21:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.hqrg1w53201w)).
*   **Media Relationships and Mainstream Focus** David Metcalfe emphasized the importance of developing relationships with mainstream news media, beyond niche publications, to increase the society's impact. This aligns with the proposed restructuring of membership to attract a broader audience ([00:23:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.bf8apvr6mw1z)).
*   **Website User Experience** David Metcalfe suggested that the society needs to improve its website's user experience, as it is currently functional but not user-friendly ([00:26:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.lrxm6nimywtn)). They proposed a usability study, especially in light of the planned membership restructuring ([00:27:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.fgq6e96rv4i6)). David recommended connecting with Zach Swenson for assistance with this ([00:27:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.ww3u357s6da7)).
*   **Community Reading Circle Enhancements** David Metcalfe reported that the community reading circle is going well but could be enhanced with a more structured format, including announcements of upcoming events and related materials. They suggested adding a welcome and closing script to create a better experience ([00:28:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.chrwavowox74)).
*   **Monthly Newsletter Idea** David Metcalfe proposed creating a monthly newsletter to disseminate information more broadly. This would complement the existing community reading circle emails and could provide a more structured approach to communication ([00:29:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.lpaw8f8agv6e)).
*   **Baltic Sea Project Marketing** Rafael Di Carlantonio inquired about marketing efforts for the Baltic Sea project ([00:30:33](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ltL7Jgf7cvaXyd6tVubLJLh87nbqetTM6i_P-VtA3E/edit?tab=t.umimrpzd6e2#heading=h.n74mz7xzay5m)).

Michael Cifone and Rafael Di Carlantonio discussed the potential for creating courses and content in video format using such AI tools ([00:39:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.fz5t387dl3k1)).
*   **Draft Language for Course Conduct and Curriculum Input** Michael Glawson reported drafting language for core state quorum standards to address troublesome students in courses. Michael Glawson also created a Google form to solicit input for the co-created foundations of UAP studies curriculum and requested suggestions on content and potential recipients for the survey ([00:40:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.bob3j8v3ps29)).
*   **Outreach to Greg Bishop for News Desk and Promotion** David Metcalfe reached out to Greg Bishop to initiate the news desk project and to promote the society at conferences. They discussed creating a simple society card with the logo and website link for Greg Bishop to distribute ([00:41:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.ui1h4cnob40l)). David Metcalfe and Michael Cifone agreed to collaborate on the design of this card ([00:43:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.1ubciin1osdu)).
*   **Briefing for Directors on News Desk Initiative** Michael Cifone suggested providing a brief overview of the news desk initiative for the directors once the details are more defined ([00:43:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.yyuy9pr1zpa)). David Metcalfe explained the concept of the news desk as a monthly, academically-grounded analysis of UAP news, contrasting it with existing often sensationalized coverage ([00:44:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.x2i37b6pulns)).
*   **Rationale and Goals of the UAP News Desk** Michael Cifone emphasized the lack of critical, organization-led analysis of UAP news and events, citing recent examples of unsubstantiated claims receiving uncritical attention ([00:45:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.cd2rhhnxwtd3)). Michael Cifone believes the society can fill this void by providing a trusted resource for critical evaluation and a comprehensive overview of the UAP landscape. The envisioned news desk would include news segments and expert analysis, similar to NPR, positioning the society as a unique and credible voice ([00:47:56](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.do78p7ioqcvv)).
*   **News Desk as a Unique Niche and Public Engagement Tool** David Metcalfe highlighted that the society's outsider status allows it to provide unbiased analysis not found elsewhere, citing an example of Fox News misrepresenting an expert's opinion ([00:49:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.hryqhnf494s8)). David Metcalfe sees the news desk as a way to engage the public, attract interest in courses, and serve as a funding mechanism ([00:52:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.jumt6066lvug)). Greg Bishop's involvement was mentioned as a ground-level contributor to conceptualize and launch the initiative ([00:53:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRqLz2yJ71hM5dDMWRbKNQycFCyg4pkVWrS8nJ3H7Qw/edit?tab=t.cppi8hyd2tcl#heading=h.u1odph9wbtnq)).

### Summary
Adam Dodd and Michael Cifone expressed concerns about the current UAP disclosure push, emphasizing the need for critical analysis of governmental transparency. The group discussed the dominant voices in disclosure, including pro-NHI individuals and former government officials, and agreed on the importance of a scholarly approach focusing on research and analysis rather than taking a stance on disclosure, as suggested by Peter Sforza. Rafael Di Carlantonio, Michael Cifone, Adam Dodd, and Peter Sforza also explored leveraging AI for organizational tasks, addressing privacy concerns, and considering tiered membership options for the public. The participants also discussed plans for the upcoming colloquium and conference, a standardized invitation process, and workflows for event promotion, while Peter Sforza and Michael Cifone detailed a strategy for integrated research proposals and potential public engagement through idea submissions, with David Metcalfe outlining plans for a newsletter and public messaging.

### Details
*   **Concerns about UAP Disclosure** Adam Dodd and Michael Cifone expressed skepticism regarding the current push for government transparency on UAPs. Adam Dodd believes the push aligns with a pattern of controlling information and perception ([00:00:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.4turgb8hw0x)). Michael Cifone emphasized the need for the organization to provide critical understanding of the disclosure discourse and its connections to the government ([00:01:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ic6lf32z7859)).
*   **Dominant Voices in Disclosure Discussions** Michael Cifone observed two main groups dominating discussions among organizations involved in UAP disclosure. One group consists of pro-NHI individuals believing in an active alien presence, exemplified by Danny Sheen and the New Paradigm Institute ([00:01:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ic6lf32z7859)). The other, more concerning group is former military and government officials, with figures like Carl Nell and Chris Mellon, who seemed to be directing the conversation ([00:03:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.qnfdtmxfnn0w)).
*   **Critique of Transparency and Disclosure** Michael Cifone argued that accepting governmental transparency on its face is absurd and that it always requires criticism and framing ([00:04:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.8zjd84cnvab7)). David Metcalfe added that the US-centric nature of the disclosure efforts doesn't align with their international organization. Both agreed that the current paradigm ignores cognitive warfare and the complexities of information operations ([00:05:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.p9o9ym1ok9fx)).
*   **A Scholarly Approach to UAP Studies** Peter Sforza suggested the organization should clarify the role of study and inquiry in relation to disclosure, empirical science, and other fields ([00:07:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.lnp4uaz6iv7x)). He advocated for a position paper that highlights their focus on asking questions and analyzing, rather than taking a stance on disclosure ([00:08:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.u0uge3jhz3mu)). Peter Sforza emphasized maintaining epistemic neutrality given the contested nature of the topic ([00:14:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.6e306cvq3eda)).
*   **Political Dimensions of UAP Disclosure** Rafael Di Carlantonio questioned the assertion that UAP disclosure is a political issue, noting bipartisan support ([00:09:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.wib2esrn416)). Adam Dodd clarified that by "politicized," they meant the phenomenon is being framed as a national security threat, potentially limiting a holistic understanding ([00:10:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.gydb0sibs6yu)). Peter Sforza highlighted that the political aspect involves budgets, authorities, and control over materials ([00:14:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.6e306cvq3eda)).
*   **Conceptual Difficulties in Disclosure** Michael Cifone pointed out the underlying conceptual difficulties in the disclosure act, especially given the lack of a stable scientific understanding of what UAPs are. Without a clear definition, the government would control the meaning of UAP in any disclosed documents ([00:15:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.9x6ds1xdvxn1)). Rafael Di Carlantonio and Adam Dodd agreed that even with disclosure, the government could still conceal or manipulate information ([00:18:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.y48bksl7shk5)).
*   **Skepticism Towards Whistleblower Claims and Evidence** The group discussed the competency and motivations of figures like Lou Alzando, questioning the quality of evidence presented ([00:20:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.mmlhbwhp6xia)). Michael Cifone detailed the process for evaluating whistleblower claims through Inspectors General and noted the lack of public follow-up on past claims ([00:33:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ocv98aaz0kir)). Adam Dodd mentioned the issue of "collective amnesia" and the potential for even significant past documents to be unpersuasive today ([00:37:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.al8jtpwlncg4)).
*   **Differing Views on the Goal of Disclosure** Rafael Di Carlantonio expressed a view of disclosure as acknowledging the reality of UAPs and declassifying information to enable scientific study, similar to the restricted but studyable nature of nuclear power ([00:31:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.d075f3ezcy00)). Michael Cifone clarified that the current push for disclosure is about releasing classified data and information, which Rafael Di Carlantonio believes is unlikely to happen if significant technology is involved ([00:33:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.wy3emljrh3cc)).
*   **The Society's Role in UAP Discourse** Michael Cifone reiterated that the organization's role is to provide criticism, framing, and analysis, not to engage directly in the political goals of disclosure movements ([00:04:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.8zjd84cnvab7)). The society's advisors are generally of the same mind, emphasizing their international scope and the problematic nature of the topic itself ([00:06:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ymw3njg1unfb)). Michael Cifone stated that while individual members can sign petitions, the organization's focus is on research, education, and pedagogy ([00:40:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ai0szoyd2ciy)) ([00:43:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.952mts3s25b1)).
*   **Focus on Fundamental UAP Research** Rafael Di Carlantonio emphasized the importance of studying the fundamentals of UAPs, considering potential gaps in engineering or physics ([00:41:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.vahs28ah0emz)). Michael Cifone affirmed that supporting empirical science and diverse methodologies for understanding the phenomenon is a core part of their mission. The aim is to promote a comprehensive understanding across various disciplinary perspectives ([00:41:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.djf0dld2w88z)).
*   **Leveraging AI for Organizational Advancement** Rafael Di Carlantonio reported on progress in developing AI agents to automate tasks and utilize ClickUp for organizational management ([00:46:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.x5cebzjq0741)). They proposed offering access to advanced AI models like GPT-4.0 to subscribers ([00:48:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.tomdwrrvf6hq)) ([00:58:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.vb1yeg40c0nq)). Michael Cifone suggested considering a dedicated AI officer at the C-suite level to oversee the utilization of AI tools ([00:49:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.6pxep3t7j2fy)) ([00:54:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.nadjtlpmn6c)).
*   **Privacy and Ethical Considerations of AI Use** The group discussed the need for serious consideration of privacy and data usage implications when implementing AI tools, especially regarding the aggregation and centralization of information ([00:50:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ap7yfgbw2mag)). Michael Cifone emphasized the need to establish strictures and principles for the use of official correspondence and shared data in AI systems ([00:52:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.xsv5c4cu5rg5)). Rafael Di Carlantonio agreed that these discussions need to happen soon as AI implementation progresses ([00:53:10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.m3l1zgmz5zua)).
*   **Building an Administrative AI Unit** Michael Cifone proposed starting by building an administrative AI unit to help directors and C-suite members coordinate efforts and create an administrative knowledge hub ([00:55:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.bzzbzmfuxovy)). They suggested including a proviso in work agreements regarding data sharing for administrative purposes. Michael Cifone expressed caution regarding making a society AI database a paid access feature ([00:56:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.839suw6wgaxb)).
*   **Tiered Membership and Knowledge Database** Rafael Di Carlantonio proposed a tiered system for the general public membership, potentially offering access to a knowledge database at higher tiers. Michael Cifone expressed concern about the signaling of a "pay-to-play" model for knowledge access, suggesting that affiliate members already receive this benefit. They agreed that a larger discussion involving the advisory council is needed to determine the strategy for these tiers ([00:59:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.z3dxof5buyr)).
*   **Distinction Between Public and Scholar Memberships** Rafael Di Carlantonio clarified that their membership redesign focuses on the general public interested in UAP, aiming to bring them to the organization's cause, not the academic scholars who are considered affiliates ([01:00:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.1kmzlifbmaj9)). He inquired about the benefits and workings of the affiliate membership for scholars. Michael Cifone explained that scholar affiliates typically receive benefits like professional development, conference discounts, video content, and course discounts, and that future seminars would also be discounted ([01:01:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.aj1q67gxahs2)).
*   **Criteria for Affiliate Membership** Rafael Di Carlantonio questioned the restrictions for becoming an affiliate, such as whether an engineer could qualify. Michael Cifone stated that affiliate criteria generally include publishing in the UAP field or related areas, or active membership in credible organizations like the SEU or the SOUL Foundation ([01:02:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ik9zsg7yd3ef)). He emphasized the need for a clear distinction between the public membership tiers and the affiliate membership requirements ([01:04:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ywcmqtssxkke)).
*   **Public Membership Tiering Concerns** While Rafael Di Carlantonio cited examples of tiered memberships for public figures like Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael Cifone remained hesitant about implementing a tiered structure for the general public membership, citing concerns about the signaling and premature revenue generation, especially considering the AI landscape ([01:05:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.vs3u75mz7159)). Michael Cifone acknowledged the need to redesign the membership structure overall. Rafael Di Carlantonio stressed that engaging the general public through a membership program is crucial for funding and advancing their research initiatives ([01:06:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.z5p76rfrw26s)).
*   **Importance of Credibility and Public Relations** Michael Cifone emphasized the necessity of maintaining top-level credibility and a sophisticated image to attract scholars and avoid signaling sensationalism ([01:07:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.cse9ylpw5vlf)). He stated that public relations considerations would moderate the membership redesign suggestions to ensure the society's credibility within the field ([01:07:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.hgn7z36n2ceh)). While acknowledging the potential for public membership tiers, Michael Cifone underscored the importance of balancing revenue generation with the organization's core purpose of supporting scholarship and science ([01:07:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.cse9ylpw5vlf)) ([01:08:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.wn4wb4r0ry2d)).
*   **Colloquium Speaker and Conference Workflow** Adam Dodd announced that Jim Madden has confirmed as the colloquia speaker for August 15th. Adam Dodd and Michael Cifone are in the process of formalizing a workflow for the annual conference organization ([01:09:53](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.yxwcpfk1wbp)). Adam Dodd anticipates accelerating this work during an upcoming four-week mid-semester break and will involve Rafael Di Carlantonio as needed for programming within their project management system ([01:10:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.jtje10obwnt5)).
*   **Standardized Invitation for Participation** Adam Dodd will contact Rafael Di Carlantonio to collaborate on formalizing a standardized invitation for participation in the conference and possibly the colloquia. Adam Dodd expects to finalize this in the next few weeks to begin sending out invitations and filling the conference roster once their assignment marking is completed ([01:10:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.jtje10obwnt5)).
*   **Workflow for Event Creation and Promotion** Michael Cifone informed the team that Zack Swenson will be assisting with creating events and programs on the website once they are scheduled and confirmed, then handing them off to media and communications for advertisement ([01:11:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.99i3hfhoju77)). This process aims to establish a clear flow from event confirmation to website creation and public promotion, with potential coordination on language for public relations. Rafael Di Carlantonio mentioned having a workflow in mind and had started working on it in ClickUp, pending an upgrade ([01:12:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.mslt11uf4nok)).
*   **Strategic Planning and Organizational Leadership** Peter Sforza reflected on the discussion about technology leading the organization rather than the core mission, emphasizing the importance of directorates providing leadership. Peter Sforza mentioned the need to put forward a strategic plan, incorporating plans from different directorates to reflect the organization's reputation and core objectives ([01:13:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.swco0q5tf22o)). Peter Sforza has been working on strategic planning and is also preparing talking points for the upcoming SCU conference ([01:14:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ygnc5cf4299)).
*   **Research Proposal Call and Institutional Integration** Peter Sforza discussed the phase zero research plan for RFPs, noting it needs further refinement. Michael Cifone suggested Peter Sforza coordinate with David Metcalfe on language for the general announcement and call for research proposals, particularly for what will be discussed at SEU. The primary idea for SEU is to promote a general call for research proposals to aggregate projects under the society and develop a coherent dossier ([01:15:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.5zxs6jc6d5rp)).
*   **Institutional "Brain" and Innovative Integration** Michael Cifone elaborated on the concept of creating an institutional "brain" by integrating research projects to produce new knowledge, potentially leveraging AI ([01:17:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.iz57s7r2trk7)). He highlighted the innovativeness of having an institution-level framework to integrate independent projects, contrasting this with typical research institutions ([01:19:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.aeiaxzdxoc44)). Michael Cifone explained that this integrated approach, inspired by Peter Sforza, could analyze cross-proposal relationships and potentially use a framework like the Batesonian model ([01:18:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.q1xrhlkl2wdz)).
*   **Benefits of Integrated Research** Michael Cifone argued that the integrative approach aligns with the comprehensive nature required for UAP studies, potentially leading to new knowledge and attracting funding ([01:19:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.aeiaxzdxoc44)). Peter Sforza affirmed the value of this metacognitive approach and mentioned testing the Bateson framework. Peter Sforza noted that the Bateson framework is one of many, and a more fundamental aspect of orders of inquiry is being uncovered ([01:20:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.2fc6otmzc502)).

*   **Interest in New Macy Conferences and AI Considerations** Peter Sforza reported hearing interest from Nora Bateson's colleague in the idea of new Macy conferences. Peter Sforza also raised questions about the relationship between AI and NHI (non-human intelligence), noting James Madden and others have explored this ([01:24:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.r78y3fydwvgs)).
*   **Proposal Submissions from Non-Scholars** Rafael Di Carlantonio questioned how non-scholars could submit proposals for phase zero research. Peter Sforza acknowledged this as a crucial question and noted that the discussion about public interface and tiers was helpful in considering what kind of proposals and projects they are trying to attract ([01:25:56](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.5qj1kuazckz0)). Peter Sforza stated that he doesn't currently have a definitive answer regarding the scope and requirements for proposals, suggesting a need to consider typical grant sizes and desired study types ([01:27:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ipu1sl538njk)).
*   **Budgetary Guidelines for Research Proposals** Michael Cifone suggested looking at adjacent grant proposal structures for guidelines, mentioning categories like living stipends, travel, and materials. He clarified that researchers would need to submit a budgetary breakdown and justification for their proposals, which the institution would then evaluate ([01:28:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.1dupd32oyut5)). Michael Cifone mentioned that their incoming grants development director could further assist with establishing a standard structure ([01:30:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.gdvqkyypl1tj)).
*   **Public Idea Submissions and Matching Researchers** Rafael Di Carlantonio proposed the idea of having projects and then finding researchers for them. Michael Cifone suggested the institution might add its own projects with placeholders for funding and researcher matching ([01:30:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.gdvqkyypl1tj)). Peter Sforza found the idea of public submissions from non-scientists interesting, especially if their data could contribute to meta-research ([01:31:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.l38e15oqe4o1)). Michael Cifone proposed creating a public idea submission portal or "idea hub" with filtration levels to identify promising ideas and potentially match them with researchers, resembling a form of citizen science ([01:31:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.50ppwqkhhq9n)) ([01:33:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.inmudkfkyu0s)).
*   **Award System for Public Ideas** Michael Cifone suggested an annual or biannual evaluation of public ideas, potentially awarding and acknowledging contributors and involving them in the project's development ([01:33:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.inmudkfkyu0s)). Peter Sforza found this compelling as a way to engage the public and bridge the gap between the community and researchers ([01:34:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.91nbw5kn78ve)). Peter Sforza also mentioned looking at Open AI's challenge as a potential model for structuring competitions and engaging the public ([01:40:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.8sts6wxks56g)).
*   **Funding Communication and Donor Influence** Peter Sforza raised concerns about how to communicate the funding process to potential proposers, particularly regarding donor influence ([01:34:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.91nbw5kn78ve)). Michael Cifone outlined two funding scenarios: donors directly funding specific projects in the dossier, or providing general funds to be allocated by an independent assessment team ([01:35:03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.cc8lue3hbjzz)). Rafael Di Carlantonio expressed a preference for a funding model based on public subscriptions that the organization could allocate ([01:36:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.nxjflo44reu0)). Michael Cifone agreed they should pursue both donor funding and public subscriptions ([01:37:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.70p5bjpl3qqf)).
*   **Public Engagement and Research Impact** Rafael Di Carlantonio emphasized pitching the phase zero project to the public by highlighting the advancement of UAP research and offering opportunities for public involvement to fund projects. He estimated the potential funding based on subscriber numbers, though Michael Cifone reminded him of operational costs ([01:37:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.idh3cs894l9d)). Rafael Di Carlantonio believes showing real action and answers will be key to public engagement ([01:38:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.rbtbd6bi9po2)). Peter Sforza advocated for pacing themselves with RFPs, starting with a trusted group of researchers and gradually building public interest ([01:38:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.jd9cbjiz6g6z)).
*   **Collaboration with AI Companies** Peter Sforza suggested reaching out to Open AI, noting their similar challenge related to searching for the lost city of Z using AI, and potentially partnering with them ([01:40:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.8sts6wxks56g)). David Metcalfe cautioned that the SOUL Foundation might already have connections with Open AI through Jonathan Bertie ([01:41:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.gw1txf8uxsp8)). David Metcalfe suggested exploring collaborations with other AI companies as well ([01:42:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.ed4bxzjl8h3o)). The idea of further brainstorming potential AI collaborations was added to the to-do list ([01:43:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.f18cz1aey3yn)).
*   **Newsletter and Public Messaging** David Metcalfe announced that Deb West is on board for the newsletter, requiring project management input from Rafael Di Carlantonio for content. David Metcalfe highlighted the newsletter as a platform for both public and internal messaging, relevant to Peter Sforza's talking points for SEU ([01:43:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.f18cz1aey3yn)). David Metcalfe also suggested creating a one-sheet with talking points for advisory board members like Hussein and Greg Bishop attending SEU ([01:44:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.8zj3u9pf58e2)).
*   **Leveraging "Dark Social" and Influencers** David Metcalfe discussed leveraging "dark social," where non-branded influencers share the organization's talking points on social media. He gave an example of a podcast host promoting Michael Cifone's work and the society ([01:45:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.xho7fhyd9xfs)).
*   **Potential Anchor for News Desk Idea** Michael Cifone suggested Caleb Mayo as a potential charismatic anchor for the news desk idea, possibly paired with an academic ([01:46:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.iosjyyse66ro)). David Metcalfe agreed Caleb could be a good host but cautioned about the framing, as Caleb is an actor, referencing another instance of a non-journalist portraying a news anchor ([01:46:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.6xgtiqjyknsw)). David Metcalfe emphasized the need for careful messaging and suggested considering rotating hosts and ensuring diversity in the visuals ([01:47:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX54nD4B_TJKFBlVS1MqqOwxaqtEvfa0XeXIP8Tyebs/edit?tab=t.51ajyqbhy7wy#heading=h.8e2zhqes1r9g)).

He had positive discussions with Richard Hoffman and noted interest from SCU members in responding to the call. Peter and Peter Reali discussed the collaboration between their organizations, as SCU frequently mentioned their society ([01:31:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.do15389ida7i)).
*   **Complementary Strengths of Research Organizations** Peter Sforza suggested that while all groups should pursue various approaches, their society might have a stronger coordination role due to SCU's grounding in empirical sciences ([01:33:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.2ka1r01c22eo)). Michael Cifone agreed, noting that this allows for more fluidity across different domains of study ([01:34:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.o6mp9rbdbsh5)).
*   **Formation of a Center for Advanced Studies** Michael Cifone proposed the creation of a Center for Advanced Studies at the society to foster higher-level integration of research ([01:34:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.o6mp9rbdbsh5)). He envisioned this center supporting fellowships, grants, and providing institutional framing for researchers ([01:35:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.vu6hntdeia)). Peter Sforza supported this idea as a way to build research infrastructure ([01:40:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.lvaezz18xx46)).
*   **Interdisciplinarity and Knowledge Production** Michael Cifone described their approach as not just conducting projects but also building a way of producing new knowledge through cross-project and cross-disciplinary interconnections. Peter Sforza agreed that they are giving substance to interdisciplinarity by trying to build a way of creating new knowledge. Michael mentioned the potential of using frameworks like Bateson's to see higher-level integrations ([01:36:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.piiifvsgbyxm)).
*   **Vision for a Research Institute** Michael Cifone shared a long-term vision of establishing a research institute with fellowships, covered expenses, and a collaborative environment. He suggested potential locations in Los Angeles, Europe, and Australia ([01:37:32](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.ygjgx5vqlbag)). Michael sees the current developments as the foundation for this eventual center ([01:38:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.7fsgd6njbpxi)).
*   **Integration of Sciences and Descriptive Approaches** Peter Sforza highlighted conversations about integrating sciences and the descriptive approach being taken. Michael Cifone agreed that they are making connections and documenting them before layering on analysis. Peter noted that this descriptive approach could also become a diagnostic tool ([01:38:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.7fsgd6njbpxi)).
*   **Staggered Levels of Integration in Research** Michael Cifone and Peter Sforza discussed the idea of keeping the levels of research integration somewhat separate initially, with higher-level integration happening later. This allows for the foundational work to occur before broader connections are made. Michael likened this to a Hegelian process ([01:39:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.x1afk3p38l92)).
*   **Institutionalizing Interdisciplinary Research** Michael Cifone noted the challenge of converting their ideas into an administrative structure. Peter Sforza agreed, stating that past attempts within traditional institutions faced resistance. Peter believes UAP science requires and is a perfect fit for this type of interdisciplinary approach ([01:40:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.lvaezz18xx46)).
*   **Simultaneous Occurrence of Research Levels** Peter Sforza clarified that while a staged approach might be useful for public communication, different levels of research and analysis likely occur simultaneously. He emphasized that the story told to the public needs to acknowledge the complexities involved in moving beyond purely materialistic approaches ([01:41:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.s41y4ggkgkt4)).
*   **Messiness of Scientific Discovery** Michael Cifone and Peter Sforza discussed the messy and non-linear reality of scientific discovery, contrasting it with rational reconstructions ([01:42:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.sjidfhjn9ehn)). They pointed out that historical context and even initial errors often play a role ([01:43:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.c7cte7orork8)). Michael highlighted the difference between the context of discovery and the context of justification in science ([01:44:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.p50i443mrvp4)).
*   **Intuition and Guesswork in Science** Peter Sforza and Michael Cifone noted the role of intuition and even seemingly irrational guesses in scientific breakthroughs, citing Planck's discovery of discrete energy levels ([01:44:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.p50i443mrvp4)). Michael emphasized that researchers operate at different levels, from basic data collection to higher-level integration ([01:45:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.cacypddndwko)). He believes their initiative is attractive because it allows for contributions at multiple levels and aims to institutionalize a dynamically evolving epistemic ecosystem ([01:45:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.45a0lnb1y4si)).
*   **Funding and Institutional Models for Interdisciplinary Research** Michael Cifone believes they can secure funding to develop their interdisciplinary approach and offer it as a model to other research institutes. He argued that UAP studies, by its nature, requires operating at multiple levels and across disciplines due to its anomalous and multifaceted nature ([01:46:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.enclgqcrxdo6)).
*   **Formative Moment and Paradigm Shift in UAP Studies** Michael Cifone described the current state of UAP studies as a formative, pre-paradigmatic stage. He sees the society and its journal, Limina, as being in a phase transition, moving from a less critical approach to a more rigorous and interdisciplinary science ([01:47:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.ns04gd84y1qq)). Michael believes their work in creating an open, porous, and multi-level institutional model reflects the needs of 21st-century research ([01:50:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.5tilk2iqez2l)).
*   **Need for Standards and Addressing Semiodic Challenges** Michael Cifone and Peter Sforza emphasized the importance of developing institution-level standards and best practices for their work, given the lack of existing models. They also discussed the deeper semiodic challenges of interoperability between different disciplinary languages and frameworks ([01:51:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.li84kfur8itg)). Peter noted his long-standing work on interoperability, highlighting the complexities from syntactic to conceptual levels ([01:51:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.b5x6ree7twj0)).
*   **Complexity of UAP Research and the Pal Effect** Michael Cifone highlighted the noisy and dense nature of UAP data, along with the social and cultural complications ([01:52:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.hvef0ekg2cql)). He referenced the "Pal effect," where a minor anomaly can be amplified through psychosocial processes to become legendary or mythical ([01:53:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.62j1s855ypad)). This complicates the identification of the true nature of UAP and the reliability of data ([01:54:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.pji8tuv327i3)).
*   **Challenges in Historical and Forensic Studies of UAP** Michael Cifone discussed the difficulty in conducting natural history or forensic studies of UAP due to its unresolved nature and potential heterogeneity. He contrasted this with the study of meteors, where historical accounts can be matched with known phenomena ([01:54:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.pji8tuv327i3)). Michael critiqued approaches that attempt psychosocial explanations for UAP without rigorous first-order characterization ([01:56:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.i5oks8nsky1l)).
*   **Review of a Book on Eyewitness Testimony** Michael Cifone mentioned receiving a book by Vicente Ballister Almo on the reliability of eyewitness testimony for review. He expressed concerns about the book's lack of distinction between forensic and scientific evidence and its premature postulation of psychosocial hypotheses ([01:56:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.i5oks8nsky1l)). Michael considered asking Corey to review it but noted its length. Peter Sforza offered to run the text through diagnostics if available ([01:57:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.x1re1teuhb8h)).
*   **Concluding Remarks and Future Meetings** Michael Cifone thanked everyone for their participation, acknowledging the meeting often takes the form of a seminar. He noted the note-taking process and the need to end the meeting formally ([01:58:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBgve5ryRDlg2izrJQ1SxDDF4WWuKqxKoFKXu1UAAkk/edit?tab=t.8dgdb16pc5z0#heading=h.n7oqcjj1n8c)). Michael bid farewell to the participants across different time zones .

### Summary
Michael Cifone provided an update on the Baltic Sea Anomaly (BSA) project's successful first deployment, noting a second deployment is planned to gather more detailed data and potentially interact with the object. He and Adam Dodd discussed framing BSA research around developing scientific methodology for investigating anomalies, the nature of anomalies, and historical examples of lost technologies. Rafael Di Carlantonio highlighted considerations of past sea levels and geological stability of the Baltic Sea in relation to the anomaly, while the participants also discussed the society's role in supporting unconventional research, offering administrative support to other projects, and preparing for potential skepticism and ridicule. Michael Cifone also announced that Beatatric's paper on vanishing and appearing sources was accepted, and Rafael Di Carlantonio reported on operational updates and strategic planning.

### Details
*   **Baltic Sea Anomaly Project Update** Michael Cifone provided an update on the Baltic Sea anomaly (BSA) project, noting the successful first deployment of phase one. The Swedish research vessel, equipped with advanced marine research technology, recovered data and interesting imagery ([00:00:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.ggj7wh34o4v7)). The team is planning a second deployment for late August or September, aiming to gather more detailed data using advanced scanning equipment like LAR and 3D sonar, while also comparing the area to a control site ([00:02:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.dghhsiykb66l)) ([00:04:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.yn0n9o70fq07)).
*   **Framing the Baltic Sea Anomaly Research** Michael Cifone emphasized that the project's primary goal is to develop a scientific methodology for investigating anomalous structures, rather than proving any specific hypothesis about the BSA's origin ([00:04:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.yn0n9o70fq07)) ([00:07:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.cvnx0q4ab650)). He highlighted the challenges of conducting such research in unexplored marine environments and the need to build a framework involving various scientific disciplines ([00:06:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.9tea286p4rw)). The aim is to reframe the narrative around the BSA as an exercise in developing new scientific approaches for anomaly hunting on Earth ([00:08:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.9qjwobxfn7uc)).
*   **The Nature of Anomalies and Artifacts Over Time** Adam Dodd raised the question of what a very old artificial artifact might look like, referencing Martian surface anomalies ([00:11:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.fqey82yxwc3x)). Michael Cifone mentioned the Solarian hypothesis, which considers the potential for extinct advanced civilizations on Earth, and the challenge of preserving evidence over geological time due to tectonic activity ([00:13:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.w5gkvwg6x0uu)). The discussion touched on the difficulty of distinguishing ancient artifacts from natural formations and the potential for technology to be integrated seamlessly with nature ([00:16:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.h0l08gll5t6o)).
*   **Historical Examples of Lost and Mysterious Technologies** The discussion expanded to historical examples of lost technologies, such as Roman concrete, and unexplained ancient constructions like the pyramids and Pumapunku, highlighting the possibility of advanced knowledge that has been lost or is not fully understood ([00:18:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.3ldot25mxoah)). Adam Dodd noted the cultural management of architectural anomalies and the varying perceptions of the term "anomaly" within different academic communities ([00:19:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.g8wbqfmw4ru)).
*   **The Concept of "Anomaly" in Scientific Discourse** Michael Cifone and Adam Dodd discussed the surprising lack of scholarly literature specifically addressing the concept of "anomaly" in the philosophy of science ([00:22:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.o5m2q6fi5xuh)). They agreed that anomalies often emerge as what cannot be explained by existing frameworks, representing a form of "coordinated ignorance" necessary for defining the boundaries of knowledge ([00:23:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.7opztsol4i77)).
*   **Considerations of Past Sea Levels and Geological Stability** Rafael Di Carlantonio pointed out that the Baltic Sea level was significantly lower during the last ice age, suggesting the anomaly might have been on dry land. Michael Cifone confirmed that the science team is aware of this and the geological history of the Baltic Sea ([00:24:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.yqkjb54kd3dx)). The potential for geological instability, like methane pockets, was also raised as a safety concern before any physical interaction with the object ([00:40:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.p8esrh3vevd)).
*   **Potential for Physical Interaction and Advanced Imaging** Michael Cifone mentioned the possibility of interacting with the Baltic Sea anomaly in the second deployment, including core drilling to retrieve samples ([00:40:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.p8esrh3vevd)). Advanced imaging techniques, such as LAR surface scans and ground-penetrating radar, are planned to obtain detailed information about the object's structure, although the salinity of the water presents a challenge for radar ([00:41:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.kvfbhx7ep529)).
*   **The Society's Role in Supporting Unconventional Research** Michael Cifone emphasized the society's role as an administrative, conceptual, and intellectual resource for projects like the BSA, positioning it to attract other research groups needing support ([00:28:53](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.1l7n18mg2kjp)). He clarified that the society is currently administering funds and providing consultation for the BSA project, but could potentially sponsor and conduct its own research in the future ([00:30:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.qm9g671rmrcb)). The goal is to build a solid infrastructure to support such endeavors ([00:43:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.1sxcinbn5aoi)).
*   **Offering Administrative Support to Other Projects** Michael Cifone suggested that the society could offer its administrative expertise to other projects facing management challenges, such as the Galileo Project ([00:31:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.6v4iwj4qku1a)). Rafael Di Carlantonio agreed, highlighting the baseline for project management developed by the society ([00:50:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.6imr76j03qud)). The potential to approach the Galileo Project with an offer of administrative support was discussed, allowing scientists to focus on research ([00:51:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.3pb0jhb1695f)).
*   **Preparing for Potential Skepticism and Ridicule** Adam Dodd raised concerns about potential escalated attacks and ridicule if strong evidence of non-human origin is found ([00:32:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.a1nei7snb2ya)). Michael Cifone suggested the society could form a task force involving humanities and social sciences experts to address the sociological and cultural challenges of defending unconventional findings ([00:34:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.qucr6fjntury)) ([00:36:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.8idgtdv0y7w1)). He emphasized the importance of rigorous scientific defense alongside social and humanistic support ([00:35:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.1yivw43n6fty)).
*   **Update on Beatatric's Research on Vanishing and Appearing Sources** Michael Cifone announced that Beatatric had a significant paper accepted in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, detailing a new method for cleaning astrometric data and the discovery of a transient candidate in 2021 ([00:44:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.8620tdyv7qd1)). This research, part of her Vasco project, involves finding vanishing and appearing light sources and has potentially significant implications for the field ([00:45:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.mtufj8omadzr)). A colloquium with Beatatric and Wes Waters to discuss the paper was suggested ([00:46:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.bq4x66xym7fw)).
*   **Operational Updates and Strategic Planning** Rafael Di Carlantonio reported on the progress of developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and centralizing projects and tasks within ClickUp ([00:47:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.j5t0cjidryq0)). Michael Cifone emphasized the need for clear departmental goals with timelines, which will then be fleshed out into strategic implementation plans by each department head ([00:48:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.z3edyuobnllk)). This will help shape the society's workflow and organizational structure ([00:49:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwwq2gn4Mj0TDpzQ7Qhow96n2h3mHMZ7L18X-JNf8s8/edit?tab=t.qf4bdmqsdy1i#heading=h.n9u6bu4tpcxl)).

### Summary
Michael Cifone, Rafael Di Carlantonio, and Peter Sforza discussed refining communication strategies and external outreach for proposals, with Michael Cifone highlighting flagship projects and emphasizing the flexibility of their framework. They also addressed feedback from Laura Dominant regarding the framework's rigor and discussed strategic planning for securing initial proposals from individuals like Doug, Karen Austin of the John Emac Institute, and Kimberly Engles. Key discussions also included strategic academic engagement, public outreach through the MOOC seminar, the importance of financial sustainability through a membership model, and the organization's policy on patenting and commercialization.

### Details
*   **Donor Communications and Project Highlights** Michael Cifone reported receiving a promising email from donors, indicating that their request has been passed to the "money people". He mentioned highlighting flagship projects, including their recently launched "baby" project, without specifying numbers in the email ([00:02:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.bajqii7flcu6)).
*   **Feedback on Framework Rigor** Rafael Di Carlantonio shared critical feedback from Laura Dominant regarding the project framework, noting it is perceived as "very critical" and "very engineering" in its language, which scientists are not accustomed to. Michael Cifone suggested that the feedback likely stems from the stringency and expected requirements, emphasizing the need to communicate the framework's flexibility ([00:02:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.7l8j1rbditgh)).
*   **Refining Communication and External Outreach** Peter Sforza suggested emphasizing the flexibility of the research program while maintaining the rigor of grant management, recommending a nuanced change in language to improve reception ([00:04:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.9faumcdzl6zm)). Michael Cifone explained their strategy to attract internal proposals first to directly communicate expectations and flexibility, which will help refine the language for a broader external call for proposals ([00:05:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.m7xuz2dcv1us)).
*   **Strategic Planning for External Proposals** Rafael Di Carlantonio confirmed he has developed a plan for external outreach, including reinforcing their message and pushing for both membership attraction and requests for proposals. He noted that this push is necessary now that the initial phase has launched ([00:06:33](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.depvh7l54l4b)).
*   **Securing Initial Proposals** Michael Cifone outlined the progress in securing proposals, including one from Doug, a solicited interest from a physicist, and anticipated proposals from the "experiencer world," specifically mentioning Karen Austin of the John Emac Institute and Kimberly Engles ([00:07:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.jcd9hp4tj7i)). He intends to perform internal legwork to encourage submissions ([00:08:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.j64iqhcfrwhn)).
*   **Refining Messaging for External Communication** Michael Cifone emphasized the importance of communicating the "spirit" and "idea behind" their conceptual framework rather than just its literal wording ([00:08:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.j64iqhcfrwhn)). He suggested refining language based on feedback and planning regular website updates, perhaps bi-weekly or monthly, to support an aggressive external call for proposals in approximately two weeks ([00:09:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.jkbpb815ymip)).
*   **Upcoming AARO Meeting** Michael Cifone mentioned that the AARO meeting is scheduled for next week, August 4th, 5th, and 6th, and that Peter Sforza and he had a productive alignment discussion in preparation ([00:10:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.knw72489av4l)). Peter Sforza offered to send Michael Cifone proposals for a Monday activity at the archives focusing on UAP frameworks and historical genealogy of UAP formalization ([00:11:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.vl4kxnz1ee30)).
*   **Michael Cifone's Academic Work** Michael Cifone shared that he has been working on a 17-page technical philosophical document on UAP and plans to send it to Peter Sforza for comments ([00:12:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.bgp1tdd2eqjh)). He aims to publish it in a high-impact academic journal to enhance the field's credibility, rather than their own journal, to avoid the appearance of self-publication ([00:13:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.xlgqppqp1jz)).
*   **Prioritizing the MOOC Seminar** Michael Cifone highlighted the MOOC seminar as the next priority project after the AARO upward steps, in addition to other operational tasks like hiring and conference planning. Rafael Di Carlantonio agreed, stating that it should be a main driver for membership attraction ([00:15:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.pb7l4tiwvp11)).
*   **MOOC Seminar Schedule and Technology** Michael Cifone plans to populate a weekly MOOC seminar schedule quickly, leveraging personal connections with potential speakers, aiming for a Q1 2026 launch ([00:15:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.pb7l4tiwvp11)). The primary challenge is establishing the technological infrastructure for live lectures with interactivity, with YouTube being considered but other platforms explored for enhanced engagement ([00:15:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.puj4856eia07)).
*   **MOOC Seminar as a Marketing Hook** Michael Cifone proposed using the first MOOC lecture as a public teaser to sensationalize the educational engagement aspect of the program, driving interest and attracting members ([00:17:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.kxy77zz1482p)). Rafael Di Carlantonio suggested a hybrid model: 30 minutes open to the public and 30 minutes private for supporters, potentially with Q&A sessions, as a successful strategy for membership ([00:18:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.e5aqwphrnzim)).
*   **Strategic Focus on Academic Engagement and Public Outreach** Michael Cifone emphasized that while the Baltic Sea project drives public interest due to its connection with BSA, their primary target audience for proposals and research is the academic crowd ([00:18:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.x8no0sgqhfu0)). He distinguished the MOOC lectures as pure public engagement and educational outreach, aiming to attract individuals into their research ecosystem ([00:19:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.2v8e733gyvjx)).
*   **Membership Tiers and Value Proposition** Michael Cifone suggested that the MOOC seminar should be the core hook for their new membership tier system, providing added value to members ([00:20:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.1yhh0x9u67jn)). Rafael Di Carlantonio mentioned developing AI products like games to enhance the "feel like a researcher" experience and plans to coordinate with Hamza on these initiatives ([00:20:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.nlpuk04kecj5)).
*   **Review of Website Feedback** Rafael Di Carlantonio brought up "strange feedback" received on their Wix website, which Peter Sforza and Michael Cifone reviewed, noting it was interesting and felt like a compliment despite its poetic and potentially AI-generated nature ([00:20:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.nlpuk04kecj5)). Rafael Di Carlantonio confirmed they had drafted a reply and sought approval, which Michael Cifone approved ([00:22:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.kpkpq8qsk4d5)).
*   **Engaging with Feedback and Transparency** Michael Cifone discussed the importance of engaging with sincere, even critical, feedback while being cautious about overly conspiratorial or unproductive communications ([00:23:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.hvh5rb9lwee5)). Peter Sforza suggested creating a public presentation with Q&A and an FAQ, as well as versioning the research framework to demonstrate transparency and receptiveness to criticism ([00:25:03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.gfdmixgxpxsy)).
*   **Addressing Professional Feedback** Michael Cifone identified dealing with professional feedback from Sarah and Lara as a more challenging task, requiring a balance of pushing back while respecting their scientific perspectives ([00:25:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.m60qg24cxcjv)). He highlighted that Rafael Di Carlantonio and Peter Sforza are familiar with the framework and can provide expert-level dialogue to strengthen the organization ([00:26:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.3z3nffiqapih)).
*   **Media Coverage of the Baltic Sea Project** Rafael Di Carlantonio shared that the society was mentioned twice in a Mexican sensationalist documentary with almost 100,000 views, noting its format was sensationalist but the content itself was "somehow fundamental" ([00:26:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.3z3nffiqapih)). Michael Cifone sought Rafael Di Carlantonio's impression of the mention, with Rafael Di Carlantonio believing it was an attempt to lend credibility to the news ([00:29:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.s0y8stlrf67p)).
*   **Managing Public Perception and Protocols** Rafael Di Carlantonio perceived the society's portrayal as accurately facilitating and supporting projects, but noted the need for clear protocols regarding what their Principal Investigators (PIs) can say publicly to avoid misinformation and conspiracy theories, particularly concerning Dennis's past posts ([00:30:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.y1dsx8md2iv3)). Michael Cifone cautioned against responding to sensationalist content, suggesting it legitimizes undeserving material, but agreed it serves as valuable PR data for analysis ([00:31:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.mwhoxunvti97)).
*   **Increase in Newsletter Subscriptions** Michael Cifone observed a significant uptick in newsletter sign-ups, attributing it to the recent media exposure, which he views as positive for the upcoming August newsletter ([00:33:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.d8sf7kse9hko)). He emphasized the opportunity to showcase real science and engagement, making it clear that while some content may seem boring, the exploration itself is not ([00:34:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.6ltxz64k7cbc)).
*   **Distinction Between Science and Sensationalism** Michael Cifone clarified that their organization prioritizes science and scholarship over sensationalizing UFOs, aiming to support those studying UAPs rather than selling the phenomenon itself ([00:42:40](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.2jj63l5g0edn)). He emphasized creating a structured and curated environment for public engagement that contributes to the field's long-term stability ([00:43:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.f1b7rumbi08b)).
*   **Financial Sustainability and Membership Model** Michael Cifone expressed the goal of creating a nonprofit organization where individuals can receive a salary to do UAP research, highlighting the need for operational infrastructure ([00:45:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.8qo8uh2qivlv)). He aimed to flip the historical narrative of "no money in UFOs" to "money for scholarship," suggesting a low monthly membership fee (e.g., "a coffee a month") to fund projects and provide educational outreach, community engagement, and grant money ([00:45:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.ghoaflgdchw4)).
*   **Ocean Exploration as a Unique Selling Point** Michael Cifone identified ocean exploration, as exemplified by the BSA project, as a potentially strong selling point, given the unique challenges of observing the ocean compared to space or the sky. He suggested framing Dennis's passion for exploration as a key attraction, emphasizing scientific observation and discovery rather than specific hypotheses like the Millennium Falcon ([00:47:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.3r9f7n8p1t2w)) ([00:49:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.6o7j4suvo52v)).
*   **Documenting Baltic Sea Data** Rafael Di Carlantonio suggested creating a short documentary using Baltic Sea data and footage to go viral, proposing they ask Dennis for permission to use his drone footage ([00:51:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.4q96zuut3dkx)).
*   **Documentary and Funding Opportunities** Rafael Di Carlantonio proposed creating a professional documentary about their work, suggesting Netflix or National Geographic as potential funders. Michael Cifone acknowledged the need for a crew and funding but raised concerns about the feasibility and the late stage of the project. Peter Sforza mentioned their experience working with filmmakers on pitches and discussing the importance of interviewing team members for the backstory ([00:52:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.flhixjrlp1a5)) ([00:53:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.6casthkrbqr)).
*   **Realistic Portrayal of Scientific Work** Michael Cifone emphasized the need for a realistic portrayal of their work, highlighting the mundane aspects of scientific research alongside the excitement. Rafael Di Carlantonio agreed that this kind of authentic storytelling sells well and would showcase the diverse team of philosophers, engineers, astronomers, and explorers involved ([00:55:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.eg9xvaft5ckc)).
*   **Soul Foundation and its Founders** Michael Cifone discussed the Soul Foundation, identifying Peter as one of the three co-founders, alongside Gary Nolan and Jonathan Berte ([01:00:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.cl7fbqbc4edr)). They explained that the foundation's DNA combines biotech/immunology (Gary), humanities/theory (Peter), tech/entrepreneurship (Jonathan), and the military/whistleblower component (Grush). Michael Cifone expressed reservations about the foundation's entanglement with military discourse, viewing it as "radioactivity" ([01:01:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.99jtybqfprga)).
*   **Non-profit Principles and Patents** Michael Cifone stressed that as a non-profit, their organization's core mission is academic research, emphasizing intellectual freedom for researchers, unattached to capital and profiteering ([01:03:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.g27qvdlxka8z)). Rafael Di Carlantonio inquired about the possibility of obtaining patents as a non-profit, to which Michael Cifone suggested consulting legal counsel, Dylan ([01:04:03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.ef7lidqb3qi4)). Peter Sforza elaborated on how patent rights are handled in federally funded projects and universities, suggesting that the organization needs to define its policy on commercialization ([01:07:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.7walbnhztar4)).
*   **Policy on Patenting and Commercialization** Peter Sforza recommended that the organization establish a clear policy regarding patents and commercialization, especially given that other foundations like Soul are pursuing this. Michael Cifone agreed that this issue should be on the advisory council's agenda and that Dylan, a corporate lawyer, would be an ideal person to consult ([01:08:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.me9lamgxaqh1)) ([01:11:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.pq8viczed0tx)). Peter Sforza cautioned against turning away researchers by stipulating equity but suggested that if the organization facilitates patenting costs, it could negotiate a return ([01:10:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.vqyhmw13mxxs)).
*   **Upcoming Meetings and Communication** Rafael Di Carlantonio reminded everyone to check ClickUp for updates on departmental focus and milestones, including the "aura upward design" for Peter ([01:11:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.b88ekatzzeht)). Michael Cifone noted that the Monday meeting would need to be canceled due to a dinner event, and they would be traveling for a talk in Germany and later to Lisbon ([01:12:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s320iGzG2zBj3R6zeXGlilmVJW_04H4yybyGsQd-DuQ/edit?tab=t.udu4973ioppv#heading=h.3tzkpkvdjlo3)).

### Summary
Michael Cifone provided updates on grant acceptance and financial compliance, noting that the organization is nearing half a million in donations and emphasizing the need for structured reporting and official policy documents. Rafael Di Carlantonio and Michael Cifone discussed strategically choosing projects to ensure cohesiveness for funding, with Esteban Corio inquiring about diverting grants for marketing. Michael Cifone, Rafael Di Carlantonio, and Esteban Corio also discussed communication strategies for the organization's unique funding approach, workflow improvements, the internal GPT tool and its security protocols, and the MOOC seminar and UAP Studies Press as public engagement strategies.

### Details
*   **Grant Acceptance and Financial Compliance** Michael Cifone reported that the organization is nearing completion of the process to authorize themself and the CFO to accept grants without requiring a board motion, streamlining the process for future funding ([00:00:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.17vir5jvadsc)). They also emphasized the critical need to establish a regular structure for reporting requirements to maintain IRS 501c3 designation and fiduciary responsibilities ([00:09:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.3ofw6zn1mxs6)). This includes converting informal discussions and policies into official policy documents in the wiki and ClickUp, which will be formalized once the board signs incoming resolutions ([00:10:43](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.2dng0u4of4z8)).
*   **Grant Status and Donor Relations** Michael Cifone announced that the organization is close to hitting half a million in donations, which changes their tax situation ([00:02:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.jx0aswvo30wy)). This includes a new grant from Andre for an Arctic sea expedition focusing on oceanic surface-based data acquisition, which is independent but connected to the Baltic Sea Anomaly Project ([00:05:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.bl7zztcsvj08)). Michael Cifone highlighted the importance of clear communication with donors and the public, stressing that the organization is not a traditional grant-issuing body but rather curates projects and seeks funding on behalf of researchers ([00:13:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.kw6ktx4m1s9h)) ([00:16:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.qsqm3r2vs4ut)).
*   **Strategic Approach to Project Funding** Rafael Di Carlantonio suggested that the initial portfolio of projects should be carefully chosen to ensure they relate to each other, allowing for a cohesive storyline that would make it easier to secure funding for all of them together ([00:15:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.9vns4vva89xk)). Michael Cifone agreed, emphasizing the goal to present ready-to-go projects to donors, such as Aanotos, to secure significant funding like $500,000 ([00:18:51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.syl4ab4wglxo)). This strategy is designed to address the current lack of funding for UAP research by offering an innovative solution to connect projects with donors who have established relationships with the organization ([00:17:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.9vba3a57eju3)).
*   **Communication and Marketing Strategy** Michael Cifone stressed the importance of clearly communicating the organization's unique approach to funding, ensuring that potential applicants understand that the organization helps secure funding rather than directly disbursing it ([00:13:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.kw6ktx4m1s9h)) ([00:16:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.qsqm3r2vs4ut)). Rafael Di Carlantonio proposed a campaign titled "Support What Is Real" to convey that the organization does not yet possess funds but offers a solution to the lack of legitimacy and funding in the UAP field ([00:20:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.4hf0zlt3gua6)). Michael Cifone further elaborated that the communication should frame the organization as offering an innovative solution to the problem of insufficient funding and legitimacy in UAP research ([00:21:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.5ycctd8zcuw)).
*   **Use of Discretionary Funds** Esteban Corio inquired about diverting some of the recently received grants for marketing activities. Michael Cifone confirmed that once discussions with the board of directors conclude, Rafael Di Carlantonio and they will collaborate on budget allocation for marketing and communications, emphasizing the need for funding to increase the organization's outreach and presence ([00:23:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.245ub4s6iurf)). They also noted that while a dedicated marketing department is not yet feasible, the current team under Dave is capable of tackling mission-critical projects ([00:24:51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.hm7li87hy5i)).
*   **Workflow and Weekly Updates** Michael Cifone introduced a weekly Slack query to collect updates from directors, focusing on their activities and any support they might need from leadership or the organization ([00:26:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.t55srul21z6b)). This workflow aims to improve communication and ensure that critical decisions or requests are pushed through efficiently ([00:27:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.v56wm4iezub3)).
*   **Internal GPT Tool for Workflow** Rafael Di Carlantonio introduced an internal GPT tool developed for use by leadership, which Michael Cifone clarified is accessible with a free account and does not require a professional subscription ([00:28:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.zawand6jn76f)). Rafael Di Carlantonio emphasized that this specific GPT is for internal work only and should not be shared externally due to its memory of internal documents and processes ([00:29:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.n9fs8rkykb9z)). Rafael Di Carlantonio also mentioned plans to create a separate, audience-specific GPT for scholars to use in the future, ensuring data separation and security ([00:30:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.bdpb60wq0kkd)).
*   **Security Protocols for Internal GPT** Michael Cifone raised concerns about the security of the internal GPT, specifically regarding potential data downloads and access controls. Rafael Di Carlantonio acknowledged that any user with access to the GPT could see all internal documents, policies, and SOPs, confirming that access is currently link-based ([00:30:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.bdpb60wq0kkd)). Rafael Di Carlantonio will investigate implementing user-specific access, preferably limited to society email addresses, to enhance security ([00:31:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.76s9dkr0b8k)).
*   **MOOC Seminar and Public Engagement Strategy** Michael Cifone highlighted the MOOC seminar as a flagship initiative to attract public interest and generate revenue, emphasizing the need for careful management of public relations due to the sensitive nature of the topic ([00:33:03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.k8hv088texwt)). Rafael Di Carlantonio agreed, noting its importance for membership support strategy, particularly given the recent increase in YouTube subscribers with minimal investment ([00:34:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.per4d6hk6glm)). The long-term vision includes offering high-quality courses for free by capping enrollments and funding paid instructors through widespread community support and large-scale events ([00:35:32](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.xa8z4rbgygbx)) ([00:39:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.2npy0www3tfe)).
*   **Establishing a UAP Studies Press** Michael Cifone announced plans to create the Society for UAP Studies Press, aiming to publish interesting UAP/UFO studies books, including translations of important scholarly texts and case histories from various languages. The initiative will leverage existing on-demand platforms like Amazon Kindle and utilize volunteers for design and translation, with AI tools assisting in the initial translation process ([00:47:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.5q52bodj2l1o)). This press will serve as another avenue for establishing interest and public engagement through print media, alongside exploring creative uses of other media for academic material ([00:48:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.1t1ezd2iffx)).
*   **Bridging Academia and the Public** Rafael Di Carlantonio identified a need to bridge the gap between technical academic material and the general public, suggesting the creation of videos or other tools to translate scholarly papers into accessible content ([00:49:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.w1ia9nnjpa22)). Michael Cifone supported this as a major cross-divisional project under community outreach and media, aiming to transform existing lecture materials and conference talks into consumable products for broader public engagement. This repurposing of content is intended to enhance the organization's public outreach and education mission, providing valuable material for social media and increasing community interest ([00:50:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.he0yrgbksjhs)) ([00:52:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.w7nrciz3lid7)).
*   **Legal Concerns and Content Repurposing** Michael Cifone recounted an incident where the Heinek lecture was recorded and uploaded to another YouTube channel without permission, which was promptly resolved through legal action ([00:53:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.vd3hwuu8x5vt)). This incident reinforced the need to effectively repurpose and disseminate the organization's content on its official channels to protect its intellectual property and maximize public reach ([00:54:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.cpyfbhf56ocl)). The organization plans to implement a repurposing step for all educational courses and events to ensure content is adapted for various platforms and audiences ([00:52:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4F4yevUL4x6WCZhSibNF5LxpXuU6aR5cdi33c7J1I/edit?tab=t.6hlha8yef7w1#heading=h.w7nrciz3lid7)).

# Projects



# Membership Redesign Proposal

## **Introduction**
This proposal outlines a redesigned three-tier membership structure with an array of digital and physical perks tailored for a global audience. Each tier – from a very affordable entry-level to a high-end VIP level – offers progressively greater value to members. We also present a proposal and a rollout plan for a “Udemy-style” online learning library featuring hundreds of short to medium-length UAP-related courses, alongside a structured formal academic track (non-degree but rigorous) and a member-only participation in our Research Development Initiative. 
**Three-Tier Membership Program Overview**
The new membership model introduces three tiers with monthly or annual billing options (annual plans at a discounted rate for increased retention). As membership level increases, so do the benefits and exclusivity. Table 1 below summarizes the tiers, pricing, and key benefits of the proposed program:
**Table 1: SUAPS Membership Tier Comparison**

| **Tier & Name** | **Monthly Fee (USD)** | **Annual Fee (USD)** | **Key Benefits** |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| **Tier 1 – Associate** (Entry-Level) | $7 (approx.) | ~$63 | • Access to members-only digital content (articles, newsletter, forum)<br>• Community Slack access and name listed on supporter page<br>• 25% discount on courses & events; digital membership certificate<br>10% off on formal education<br>5% discount on merchandise |
| **Tier 2 – Champion** (Enhanced) | $17 (mid-tier) | ~$153 (annual discount) | _Includes Tier 1 benefits, plus:_<br>• Access to **most online courses** (streaming library) at no extra cost<br>• **Quarterly** live webinars or Q&A with UAP researchers<br>• **50%** discount on events, and workshops; printable certificate<br>20% off on formal education<br>15% discount on merchandise<br> |
| **Tier 3 – Patron** (VIP/Leadership) | $37 (premium) | ~$333 (annual discount) | _Includes Tier 2 benefits, plus:_<br>• **Full access** to **all** courses and learning programs (free enrollment)<br>• Invitation to exclusive VIP roundtables (e.g. annual virtual summit with SUAPS leadership)<br>• Opportunity to participate in research development initiative; special recognition (website and certificate plaque)<br>30% off on formal education<br>20% discount on merchandise<br> |

_Pricing shown is a suggested starting point; final prices to be determined based on regional considerations._ 
Below we detail each tier’s offerings and how they will be delivered.
### **Tier 1: Associate Member (Entry-Level)**
**Audience & Pricing:** The Associate tier is a highly affordable entry point (around $7 per month, or ~$63/year with discount) aimed at students, young professionals, and grassroots supporters worldwide. The low cost aligns with SUAPS’s goal of broadening grassroots support (e.g. prior internal plans envisioned ~$4/month memberships for broad access). Annual subscriptions will be encouraged by offering approximately three months free.
**Benefits:** Tier 1 focuses on digital content and community access to engage members without significant fulfillment costs. Key perks include:
*   **Members-Only Content:** Access to an exclusive monthly e-newsletter with insider updates, research briefs, and early announcements (e.g. Phase 0 project news). Tier 1 members also get access to a members section of the SUAPS website containing articles, videos, and archives not available to the public. This content keeps them informed and feeling like insiders on UAP research progress.
*   **Online Community Access:** Invitation to the SUAPS Slack workspace (or a members-only forum) to discuss UAP topics with peers and experts. They can join channels for different research themes, participate in AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, and network globally. This community aspect is a core benefit to deepen involvement.
*   **Discounts & Offers:** First level discount on SUAPS virtual events, paid webinars, or merchandise is provided. For example, if SUAPS hosts an online seminar or sells UAP-related books and merchandise, Tier 1 members get a  price reduction. This incentive not only adds value but also encourages event attendance and merch sales.
*   **Recognition:** Public acknowledgment as a supporter – e.g. having their name listed on a “Member Supporter Wall” on the website (with consent). This gives entry-level members a sense of pride and belonging.
*   **Welcome Kit (Digital):** To minimize shipping costs, Tier 1 primarily offers digital welcome materials – a printable membership certificate (personalized PDF) and a digital membership badge they can share on social media. This badge helps spread awareness and gives members something to show for their support. _(Physical items are not included by default at this tier to keep it affordable and globally accessible.)_
### **Tier 2: Champion Member (Enhanced Access)**
**Audience & Pricing:** The Champion tier (around $17/month, or ~$153/year) targets enthusiasts and semi-professionals who want deeper engagement. These members are willing to contribute more and in return expect greater access to SUAPS resources. 
**Benefits:** Champion members receive all Associate benefits plus significant additional perks that further their educational and networking opportunities:
*   **Course Access – Learning Library:** Tier 2 members unlock **deeper access to the online course library.** They get unlimited access to a _larger portion_ of SUAPS’s “Udemy-style” course catalog (details of the library in the next section) at no extra cost. For example, if the library has 100 courses, Champion members might freely access most recorded courses except perhaps a few premium or cohort-based offerings. This represents a substantial value, as buying courses à la carte would be far more expensive. _(If certain advanced courses are not included, Tier 2 would still get a significant discount on those.)_
*   **Live Webinars with Experts:** On top of recorded courses, Champion members are invited to exclusive live online events. **Quarterly webinars** or virtual meetups are held for this tier, featuring SUAPS researchers, scientists, or notable experts in UAP studies. For example, a private Zoom Q&A where a leading UAP scientist presents new findings or discusses research projects (only for Champion and Patron tiers). These interactive sessions provide networking and learning in real-time, a perk not available to Tier 1.
*   **Larger Discounts:** Champion members enjoy larger discounts on SUAPS offerings on ticketed workshops, online conferences, or merchandise. If SUAPS sells books, apparel, or equipment via an online store, Champion members get a higher discount code.
*   **Partial Physical Perks:** Tier 2 members could receive a welcome package with some branded merchandise, while keeping shipping feasible. For example, a SUAPS enamel pin or embroidered patch (small and flat for inexpensive global mailing) and a printed membership card or certificate could be sent. These items are lightweight and have modest cost, making global delivery feasible. We can use international postage or print-on-demand services with global fulfillment to send these. (Alternatively, SUAPS can provide a redeemable coupon for a free item from an online merchandise store that ships internationally, so the member can claim their item directly.)
*   **Community Recognition:** Champion members might be highlighted separately (e.g. an honor roll for higher-tier supporters in an annual report or on the website). While Tier 1 had a supporter wall, Tier 2 could be denoted with a special badge or category, emphasizing their “champion” status in supporting UAP research.
**Global Delivery Considerations:** Tier 2 introduces some physical perks but keeps them small scale to control cost. Items like pins, certificates, or stickers can be mailed in standard envelopes worldwide for a few dollars each. SUAPS will plan a batch fulfillment process for new Champion members: for example, printing and mailing welcome kits quarterly to accumulate international orders and obtain bulk postage rates. Digital perks (webinars, course access) remain the primary draw, ensuring that even if physical shipping is delayed, members immediately benefit upon joining. SUAPS can also offer an **“opt-out” of physical kit** option for those who prefer all-digital (or donate the cost back), which some overseas members might choose to avoid customs or delays.
### **Tier 3: Patron Member (VIP/Leadership)**
**Audience & Pricing:** The Patron tier (premium level, e.g. $37/month or higher; ~$333/year) is designed for the most dedicated and resourceful supporters – those who are deeply invested in UAP studies and the SUAPS mission, potentially including professionals in related fields or major donors. This “VIP” tier provides an all-access pass to SUAPS offerings and special status within the community. The pricing is set to reflect its high value (e.g. comparable to other nonprofit “Leadership Circle” memberships or professional society dues) but still within reach of individuals who are passionate and able to contribute more.
**Benefits:** Patron members receive every benefit of the lower tiers, with no limits plus unique VIP privileges:
*   **All-Inclusive Learning Access:** Full, unrestricted access to the entire SUAPS learning library is included in Tier 3. Every online course, module, or lecture series – including any premium content, new releases, or specialized programs – is free for Patrons. This effectively turns the membership into an “educational subscription” similar to MasterClass or Skillshare models, where a higher fee unlocks all content. Even cohort-based courses or the formal academic track (described later) are either included or heavily prioritized for Patrons. This perk alone provides immense value, as a Patron could consume dozens of courses that would otherwise cost hundreds of dollars individually.
*   **Research Participation & Leadership:** Patrons will have the opportunity to engage directly in SUAPS’s research initiatives. They can submit research proposals and receive mentorship on their ideas, and may be invited to join internal review panels or committees evaluating Phase 0 proposals (if they have relevant expertise). In essence, Tier 3 members become true stakeholders in the research process – for example, getting to review drafts of research papers or beta-test new citizen science tools. This level of involvement is both a perk and a responsibility, giving Patrons a voice in SUAPS’s projects.
*   **Exclusive Events & Networking:** Beyond the quarterly webinars for Champions, Patrons get additional VIP events. For example, an annual “Patron Summit” (virtual roundtable) with SUAPS leadership and key scientists, where strategic updates are given and Patrons can ask questions directly. This could be a video conference limited to this tier, fostering a small-community feel. Patrons might also receive invitations to any in-person gatherings or special field opportunities if available (e.g. private tours of a research lab or priority tickets to a conference SUAPS hosts, with meet-and-greet access to speakers).
*   **Premium Welcome Package:** To recognize their significant support, each new Patron member receives a deluxe welcome package shipped to their home. This could include high-quality SUAPS-branded items such as a T-shirt or hat, a mug, and a framed certificate of Patron Membership. All items would be chosen for relatively easy international shipping (apparel, paper goods) and could be fulfilled via an international print-on-demand partner to minimize hassle (ensuring local printing in major regions to reduce customs issues). The package both rewards the member and turns them into an ambassador (wearing SUAPS gear).
*   **Recognition & Prestige:** Patrons will be prominently acknowledged as key benefactors of SUAPS. For example, Tier 3 members could be listed (with permission) in an annual report under “Patron Circle” and on the website’s supporters page with a special designation. They may also receive a personalized thank-you letter signed by the SUAPS president and periodic small tokens of appreciation, such as an end-of-year gift (e.g. a printed annual compendium of UAP research highlights). The goal is to build a personal relationship with Patrons so they feel deeply valued.
## **“Udemy-Style” Online Learning Library Proposal and Rollout Plan**
A cornerstone of the membership value proposition is the creation of a learning library: an online education platform hosting hundreds of short to medium-length courses on UAP-related topics. This section details the plan to build and roll out this “Udemy-style” library. The goal is to develop a rich e-learning resource that can educate members, generate revenue, and establish SUAPS as a leader in UAP education globally.
### **Technology Stack and Platform Selection**
This will be detailed after approval.
### **Course Creation Pipeline (AI-Generated & Expert-Led Content)**
To populate a rich library of UAP-related courses, SUAPS will establish a course creation pipeline that blends expert-led content with AI-assisted development to accelerate production. The goal is to produce high-quality courses efficiently, tapping into SUAPS’s network of experts as well as modern content creation tools.
**Content Strategy:** The library will cover a broad range of UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) topics, from scientific fundamentals to specialized research findings. Course formats will be short to medium length: for example, a short course might be 30 minutes (micro-learning) to 2 hours, while a medium course could be 3–6 hours split into multiple lessons. Example course topics might include _“Introduction to UAP Physics”_, _“Historical UAP Case Studies”_, _“Research Methods for UAP Data”_, _“Psychological Perspectives on UAP Witnesses”_, etc. Members can pick and choose or gradually progress through a structured learning path.
**Pipeline Stages:** We propose the following workflow for continuous course creation:
1. **Ideation & Planning:** Identify course topics based on member interest, expert availability, and strategic priorities. Ideas can come from SUAPS researchers (e.g., someone wants to turn their expertise into a course), from frequently asked questions in the community, or even from existing materials (e.g., recorded conference talks, seminars that can be repurposed). Maintain a content calendar to schedule course production so that new courses are released regularly.
2. **Outline & Script Development:** For each course, create an outline of lessons. Here AI tools can assist. For example, using ChatGPT or other AI writing assistants to draft a course outline and even initial script content for lessons. AI can quickly generate structured content given prompts (e.g. “Outline a 5-lesson course on the history of UAP research”). This draft content provides a starting point, which is then reviewed and refined by a human expert. The expert (or content team member) will ensure accuracy, add case studies, and inject the needed rigor. AI can also help generate slide text or quiz questions for each lesson, again to be reviewed by humans. The key is to save time on first drafts so the experts can focus on correcting and enriching the material rather than writing from scratch.
3. **Multimedia Production:** Once the script and slides are finalized, the course needs to be recorded and packaged. SUAPS can use a mix of live recordings and AI-generated media:
    *   _Expert Lectures:_ For core topics, it’s ideal to have a human face/voice. SUAPS can arrange for subject matter experts (which could be society members, academics, or skilled volunteers) to record video lectures. This could be as simple as a Zoom recording with slides shared, or a more polished video if resources allow. We can also do audio narration over slides for those camera-shy – a slidecast style course.
    *   _AI Video and Narration:_ To scale content creation, SUAPS can utilize tools like **Synthesia** or similar AI video generators to create lectures without needing a person on camera. An AI avatar can narrate the script in a professional tone, synchronized with slides or visuals. This approach can quickly produce a video lesson once the script is ready. While it may lack the personal touch of a real instructor, it works well for basic informational content. The AI voice/video quality has improved significantly, and when used selectively, it can fill gaps (e.g., for introductory modules or whenever human production isn’t available).
    *   _Visual Aids:_ Use **Canva** or other design tools (even AI image generators if appropriate) to produce engaging visuals and infographics to include in slides. AI can generate illustrations of hypothetical UAP scenarios, charts, or concept art to make the course visually appealing. SUAPS should also leverage any existing media (photos, diagrams) it has rights to.
    *   _Quizzes and Interactives:_ For each course, include a short quiz or knowledge check. This can be generated with AI assistance (“create 5 multiple-choice questions covering these lessons”) and then curated by the content developer. If the platform supports it, also add interactive elements (e.g., reflection prompts or discussion questions in a forum).
    *   
4. **Quality Review:** Before publishing, each course should undergo a quality assurance review. If possible, have another expert or an editorial committee member review the content for accuracy and clarity (especially important in a field like UAP where misinformation must be avoided). Also gather a small pilot group (perhaps some volunteer members) to take the course and give feedback on difficulty, length, and any technical issues. This peer review process for content mirrors academic rigor – similar to how think tanks employ internal peer reviews for credibility. It ensures that even AI-assisted content meets SUAPS’s standards.
5. **Publish & Iterate:** Upload the course to the chosen platform, setting up the curriculum, videos, and quizzes. Organize courses into categories (e.g., Science, History, Policy, Experiencer Accounts, etc.) for easy navigation. Once live, announce the new course to members via email, Slack, and website. Encourage those who take the course to leave feedback. Use that feedback to make improvements over time. E.g., clarify sections that were confusing or update material if new data emerges.
**AI vs Expert Balance:** This pipeline ensures that while AI accelerates production (outlining, drafting, even narrating), human experts remain in control of the content. The resulting courses will benefit from expert knowledge and passion, with AI handling rote tasks and scale. It’s worth noting that some e-learning providers are already using AI for rapid course development. [lingio.com](https://www.lingio.com/blog/ai-tools-for-course-creation#:~:text=Key%20capabilities%20of%20Lingio%3A) – for example, tools that turn documents into interactive courses in seconds. SUAPS can explore such tools (e.g., [Coursebox.ai](http://Coursebox.ai), Lingio, etc.) which claim to generate courses from input material. They might auto-create quizzes and even gamify content. If these are affordable (or have free trials), we can pilot them for certain modules, again followed by a human review.
**Volunteer and Partner Contributions:** In addition to in-house and AI-generated content, SUAPS can invite **external contributions** to enrich the library. For example:
*   Collaboration with **academic partners**: Perhaps a professor interested in UAP studies could contribute a short course (maybe a recorded guest lecture or overview of their research specialty). SUAPS could in return offer them an honorarium or simply the exposure to the community.
*   **Member-generated content**: Advanced members (especially Patron tier) might want to create courses. SUAPS can establish a vetting process for members to propose and author a course (with guidance). This not only increases content but deepens engagement – the member becomes an instructor with recognized contribution.
*   **Re-purpose existing materials**: If SUAPS or allied organizations have archives of recorded talks, workshops, or interviews, these can be edited into course form. A 1-hour recorded lecture from a conference could become a “mini-course” with an added introduction and quiz.
By maintaining a **pipeline approach**, SUAPS can aim to build an initial critical mass of courses (say 50-100 courses in the first 6 months), then continuously add new courses each month. This keeps the library fresh, which is crucial for member satisfaction – _content creation never stops; to keep members engaged, new courses, webinars, and podcasts should be regularly offered_. A schedule (e.g. “new course every Monday”) could be advertised to create anticipation.
### **Cost Structure and Monetization Strategy**
The online learning library offers multiple avenues for monetization and value delivery. Since it ties in with membership, we need to define what is included for members versus what might be sold separately, and how non-members might access the content. The strategy should balance maximizing reach (we want people to learn about UAPs widely) with monetizing premium content to support SUAPS.
**Included vs A La Carte Access:** As a baseline, members will receive significant access to the course library as part of their benefits:
*   **Tier 3 (Patron)**: Full library access is included, except formal education. A Patron can take any course for free as long as their membership is active. This effectively makes the library a value-added service to justify their high subscription fee.
*   **Tier 2 (Champion)**: Most of the library is included, but perhaps some premium courses and formal programs might require a small additional fee or an upgrade to Tier 3. For example, 80% of courses are free to Champions, but a cohort-based 8-week intensive course might cost extra or be limited to Patrons. Champions might also get certificates included for free for self-paced courses. If any courses are priced a la carte for others, Champions get them at no cost or a steep discount (like 50–70% off).
*   **Tier 1 (Associate)**: Entry members have **limited course access**. This could mean they have free access to a **subset of courses**, such as all “introductory” level courses or perhaps a rotating selection (“course of the month”) for free. For the rest of the library, Associates could pay a discounted fee per course. For example, a course priced at $50 to the public might cost a Tier 1 member $37. This model is similar to a freemium approach where basic content is included but advanced content is paid. SUAPS might decide that Tier 1 only gets a discount and no free courses; however, including at least some learning content at Tier 1 is good for engagement and might entice them to upgrade after they get a taste.
**Non-Members (Public Access):** To broaden impact and also bring in revenue, the library can be partially open to non-members in a pay-per-course or freemium model. For instance:
*   Anyone (even non-member) can see the catalog and perhaps access a couple of free teaser courses (e.g., a “What is UAP?” intro course offered free to all, both as a public education service and a marketing lead magnet). This is similar to how some platforms use free content to draw users in.
*   Non-members can purchase individual courses for a one-time fee (just like buying a course on Udemy). This one-time purchase model is straightforward: pay a single fee for lifetime access to that course[learnworlds.com](https://www.learnworlds.com/monetization-strategies/#:~:text=1.%20One). It’s good for people who are not ready to commit to membership but are interested in a specific topic. SUAPS can price courses based on length and value – e.g., $20 for a short course, $50 for a longer one, etc.
*   SUAPS can also offer bundles of courses or an all-access pass as a product. However, an all-access pass for a non-member would basically be a membership in all but name. Instead, we direct them to membership if they want multiple courses. A possible exception: maybe an organizational license if a school or group wants access to content (not likely at first, but possible in future)
**Monetization and Revenue Expectations:** The course library will both add membership value (retention) and directly generate revenue from non-member sales. For example, if SUAPS releases a particularly popular course (say “UAP Data Analysis 101”), non-members might pay for it, and some of those could be funnelled into membership when they realize they could get more courses for free as a member. This interplay is strategic: use content as an acquisition tool for membership.
We must also consider **pricing strategy** for courses. We can research comparable offerings: Are there any existing UAP or ufology course offerings? Perhaps not many formal ones, which gives SUAPS a niche. We might benchmark against generic science MOOCs or hobbyist courses (often $20–$100 each). As a nonprofit, SUAPS might opt to price courses modestly to encourage learning rather than high profit. However, courses included “free” for members mean membership fees are the main income. The pricing for non-members primarily serves to make membership attractive (e.g., if each course is $30 and membership is $17/month, then after 2 courses membership pays off).
**Upselling and Cross-selling:** Within courses, we can gently encourage deeper involvement:
*   A non-member taking a paid course can see messages like “Members get full access to all courses and live Q&As – join SUAPS for $X/month to unlock these benefits.
*   A Tier 1 member taking a course might get a prompt: “Enjoying this content? Upgrade to Champion to unlock the entire library.”
*   We can highlight the formal academic track and other programs in the course platform to generate interest (e.g., a banner: “Interested in a structured 8-week program on UAP studies? Patron members can enroll in our Advanced Research Track.”)
### **Certification and Credentialing**
One way to increase the impact and appeal of the SUAPS learning library is to offer certificates for course completion and program completion. While SUAPS is not a degree-granting institution, certificates can provide a sense of accomplishment and credibility for participants, especially if the courses are rigorous. Here’s how certification will be handled:
*   **Course Completion Certificates:** Every standalone course in the library will award a **certificate of completion** (digital PDF) when the learner finishes all lessons and passes the quiz or final assessment. SUAPS will design a nice certificate template with its logo, the course title, instructor name, and the learner’s name. These certificates can be downloaded and even shared by learners on LinkedIn or elsewhere, showcasing that they have learned about UAP studies from SUAPS. Having this feature “baked in” adds professionalism to the library (many learners value proof of learning). It’s noted that certificates boost credibility and engagement in online courses. SUAPS will ensure the certificate template has a unique verification code or signature so that anyone viewing it can trust it came from the Society for UAP Studies (for example, a URL or QR code that links to SUAPS’s site verifying the certificate number).
*   **Pathways and Badge System:** With hundreds of courses, SUAPS can create learning paths or groupings. For example, a set of 5 courses might constitute a “Foundations of UAP Science” track. If a member completes all courses in a track, they earn a special badge or certificate of mastery for that track. This encourages taking multiple courses and gives a higher-value credential. Over time, SUAPS could develop a tiered certification (similar to bronze/silver/gold levels or beginner/intermediate/advanced scholar in UAP studies). This is somewhat gamification to motivate learners, but also a way to structure the content into coherent programs.
*   **Formal Academic Track Certificate:** (Detailed in the next section, but worth noting here) the formal, cohort-based program will culminate in a **Certificate of Advanced UAP Studies** or similar. This certificate would be more significant (perhaps signed by the SUAPS President or Education Director) and could be issued physically in addition to digitally. While not an accredited diploma, it signifies completion of a rigorous training which could be a resume enhancer for those interested in the UAP research field.
*   **Accreditation and Partnerships:** In the long-term, SUAPS might explore partnerships with academic institutions to co-sponsor certificates or continuing education credits. For instance, could these courses count as continuing education in certain scientific or educational fields? Even if not formal, we can align some courses with standards (like learning objectives, CEU calculations) so that in future an accredited body might recognize them. Initially, however, SUAPS’s own branding is what backs the certificates. The Society should maintain high standards so that the certificate means something in the UAP community – eventually perhaps recognized as a marker that someone is knowledgeable in the subject.
*   **Digital Badges:** Besides PDFs, we can issue Open Badges (a standardized digital badge format) for each achievement. These can be displayed in online profiles. There are services to manage badges, or some LMS have integrations for this. It’s a nice-to-have if resources permit. If not at launch, it can be added later as the program matures.
**Verification:** SUAPS can host a simple verification page where an employer or anyone can input a certificate code to verify its authenticity (this could be as easy as a Google Sheet listing valid cert codes or a more advanced integration). This ensures trust in the credential.
### **Content Governance and Update Strategy**
Maintaining a large library of courses requires ongoing governance to ensure content remains accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with SUAPS’s mission and standards. We propose establishing a **Content Governance Board or Committee** within SUAPS (could be a subcommittee of the Education or Membership committee) to oversee the learning library. Key responsibilities and strategies include:
*   **Quality Control and Peer Review:** As mentioned, each course should undergo review before publishing. The governance board can coordinate volunteer reviewers (e.g., 2-3 experts or knowledgeable members) to peer-review new course content for accuracy and quality. They can use a checklist (correct facts, proper citations if used, clear language, respectful tone, etc.). Particularly for any AI-generated portions, reviewers must double-check for AI “hallucinations” or errors. This internal peer review mimics academic practices and will maintain credibility, which is crucial for SUAPS’s reputation.
*   *   **Versioning and Updates:** UAP studies is a dynamic field – new research and data can emerge. Courses should not become stale or propagate outdated information. SUAPS will implement a versioning system where each course has a “last updated” date. The governance board will periodically (e.g., annually or biennially) audit courses to see if updates are needed. If a significant development occurs (say, a major UAP study is published by a government or university), relevant courses should be updated promptly to include that info. This could mean recording a new lesson or updating a slide.
*   *   **Learner Feedback Loop:** Encourage course takers to provide feedback/rating after completion. Monitor this feedback closely. If multiple learners comment that a lesson was confusing or the quiz had an incorrect answer, address it quickly. This responsiveness will improve quality and user satisfaction. It also helps identify which courses might need a refresh or which instructors might need coaching on delivery.
*   *   **Content Removal or Consolidation:** If some courses become low-quality or redundant over time (perhaps early AI-generated ones that are superseded by better expert courses later), SUAPS can remove or merge them. However, even older content might have historical value, so another approach is to archive them (visible but labeled as “Legacy course – for reference, may contain outdated info”). Transparency is important; do not quietly remove certificates that people earned, etc., but it’s fine to retire courses from the active catalog if needed.
*   *   **Ethical Guidelines:** SUAPS should create guidelines for course content to ensure it meets ethical and community standards. This includes avoiding sensationalism in UAP topics, clearly labeling speculative sections vs. established science, and not infringing on any classified or sensitive information. Given UAP topics can attract fringe theories, SUAPS’s courses must maintain a scientific tone and note where things are hypothetical. The governance committee can review content for any bias or undue influence and ensure a balanced approach.
*   *   **Updating Formats and Technology:** As technology evolves, SUAPS should keep the learning experience modern. For example, if interactive AR/VR experiences become feasible, consider integrating those for immersive learning. Or if the membership moves to a new platform, ensure the course content migrates properly. Keep an eye on LMS improvements (like the AI features in some platforms) and utilize them.
*   *   **Instructor Support and Standards:** Develop a short **“**Course Author Handbook**”** for anyone creating content. This would outline expected lesson length, format, slide design tips, how to incorporate references, etc. Also define how to handle citations in courses if needed (we may want to cite sources for certain data within the course slides, similar to how this document uses citations, to model good scholarly practice in our educational content). If SUAPS can enlist an educational specialist volunteer, they could help authors apply best practices in instructional design.
*   
Overall, the governance strategy ensures that the learning library is not a one-off project but a living educational ecosystem. SUAPS’s reputation rests on the quality of its resources, so this investment in oversight is crucial.
The SUAPS learning library will be a sustainable, scalable asset. It can start relatively small (a handful of courses) but steadily grow into a comprehensive “Udemy of UAP Studies,” all while upholding scientific rigor and serving the nonprofit mission of public education.
## **Formal Academic Track (Non-Degree but Rigorous)**
In addition to the on-demand course library, SUAPS will offer a formal academic-style track for members seeking a deeper, structured learning experience. This program will not grant an official degree, but it will simulate aspects of graduate-level education – including a cohort of peers, instructor-led modules, rigorous assignments, and a capstone project. The goal is to provide rigor and credibility comparable to academic programs, thereby training serious UAP researchers and giving participants a credential that carries weight in the community.
### **Program Structure and Format**
**Program Name:** The track could be called the _“SUAPS Advanced Research Program in UAP Studies”_ or _“UAP Studies Certificate Program.”_ The name should reflect its serious nature (avoiding the word “degree” but emphasizing advanced study or certification).
**Cohort Model:** Unlike the self-paced library courses, this track will be **cohort-based** – a group of students (perhaps 20-30 per cohort) will start and progress through the program together. Cohort-based learning has proven advantages: it builds community, increases engagement and completion rates, and allows for peer learning and networking. Students in the cohort will interact through weekly live sessions and group discussions, creating an interactive experience closer to a classroom environment.
**Duration:** The program could run for, e.g., 12 weeks (3 months) or 16 weeks (4 months), depending on how much content is included. It might be structured as multiple modules. For example:
*   Module 1 (Weeks 1-4): UAP Science Foundations – covering physics, atmospheric phenomena, sensor data interpretation.
*   *   Module 2 (Weeks 5-8): Research Methods & Analysis – covering how to design studies, statistical analysis, field investigation techniques.
*   *   Module 3 (Weeks 9-12): Specialized Topics and Capstone – covering special topics like UAP policy implications or psychological aspects, and guiding students in their capstone projects.
*   
Each week could have a mix of pre-recorded lessons (some could reuse content from the library, but often better to have dedicated ones), readings, and a live session.
**Instruction and Mentorship:** The formal track will be instructor-led. We will identify qualified instructors – ideally experts in relevant fields (could be SUAPS-affiliated researchers, academics, or experienced practitioners). For example, one instructor might be a PhD in astrophysics to teach the science module, another might be a veteran investigator to teach methodology. These instructors would conduct weekly live lectures or seminars via Zoom/Google Meet with the cohort. They will also hold office hours or Q&A forums for students. Because this is a rigorous program, instructor involvement is key to guiding participants, answering questions, and ensuring understanding.
Additionally, teaching assistants or mentors could support the instructors (perhaps advanced members who have expertise – maybe people who went through a pilot cohort earlier). Given SUAPS’s nonprofit nature, instructors might volunteer their time or be given an honorarium; perhaps a retired scientist passionate about UAPs would love to teach this as a way to contribute.
**Cohort Interaction:** Use a platform or tool for cohort communication. This could be:
*   A dedicated Slack channel for the cohort (separate from general membership Slack) where students discuss weekly topics, collaborate on assignments, and share insights.
*   *   Possibly schedule some small-group discussions or peer-review sessions as part of the learning (e.g., break cohort into teams of 4-5 to discuss a case study and report back). This enhances engagement.
*   
**Assignments and Evaluation:** To ensure rigor, participants will be given assignments much like in an academic course. Examples:
*   Weekly quizzes or reflection essays on the material.
*   A mid-point project, like analyzing a provided dataset of sightings or writing a critique of a UAP research paper.
*   The hallmark would be a **Capstone Project**: Each participant (or team of 2-3) chooses a research question or project to pursue during the program. This could be something like: “Analyze the patterns in a database of UAP reports,” or “Design a hypothetical experiment to test a propulsion theory,” or even a literature review on a specific UAP hypothesis. They would work on this in the latter half of the program with instructor guidance. The final session could be a mini “conference” where each student/team presents their capstone findings to the group. This adds a very valuable practical element — as one university’s capstone description puts it, the project allows students to synthesize knowledge and apply it to a real-world problem.
*   Grading: Since it’s not for credit, formal grades might not be necessary, but feedback is. Instructors and possibly peers will provide feedback on assignments. We could use a pass/fail or honors/pass system just to indicate completion or exceptional work. Possibly, we require certain assignments to meet a standard for the certificate to be awarded (ensuring people can’t just show up and get a cert without doing the work).
**Workload:** Expect 5-8 hours per week for participants (including watching lectures, doing readings, completing assignments). This is significant but manageable for working professionals if they are motivated. We’ll communicate upfront the commitment required.
### **Rigor and Credibility Measures**
To make this program credible:
*   **Curriculum Development:** SUAPS should assemble a small Academic Advisory Panel (which might overlap with the content governance group) to design the curriculum and learning objectives. This ensures the program covers all essential areas and is comparable to what a university extension course might cover. Each module will have clear outcomes (e.g., “By the end of Module 1, students will be able to explain X, Y, Z with scientific accuracy.”).
*   *   **Academic Rigor:** Use textbooks or reading materials of high quality. Perhaps designate a couple of reference texts (maybe chapters from aerospace or physics textbooks, or reputable UAP research publications) for participants to read. We can also assign journal articles or government reports on UAP as reading. Discussing these in live sessions will add rigor (kind of like journal club seminars).
*   *   **Assessment:** The capstone project especially should be evaluated critically. SUAPS can have a panel (instructors + maybe an external expert or two) review the final projects. If a participant’s work is subpar, the panel might require revisions before issuing the certificate. This maintains a standard and signals that the certificate isn’t just an attendance award but indicates actual competence.
*   *   **Peer Review and Presentation:** Requiring participants to present their capstone and engage in peer review of each other’s work adds to the academic atmosphere. It mirrors how graduate seminars work with peer critique. This also prepares participants to possibly publish their work or present at conferences.
*   *   **Credibility:** While not accredited, SUAPS can boost credibility by:
*       *   Publicizing the names/credentials of instructors and advisory panel (if they have PhDs or notable experience, this lends prestige).
    *   *   Possibly getting endorsements or a memo of understanding from an academic institution. For example, maybe a sympathetic professor’s department at a university could state that this program is beneficial training (even if they don’t confer credit). Or a well-known figure in the UAP research field could serve as a program patron, lending their name.
    *   *   Aligning the program’s content with common academic frameworks. For instance, ensure it teaches general research skills along with UAP specifics, so it’s broadly respectable as a research training program.
    *   
**Scheduling and Frequency:** We might offer this program 1-2 times per year (depending on demand and bandwidth). Perhaps one cohort starting in January and one in September. Keeping cohorts limited in number ensures quality of interaction. Interested members would have to apply or register ahead of time. SUAPS could have an application form if demand exceeds slots, or simply first-come-first-served but favoring qualified candidates (like ensuring Patrons get priority).
### **Integration with Membership and Costs**
We have to decide who can participate and if there is an additional fee:
*   **Who’s Eligible:** Ideally, this is a member-only benefit (at least initially). We can say it’s open to Champion and Patron members (Tier 2 and 3), with Patrons given first priority. Associates (Tier 1) might be required to upgrade to join, or perhaps they can pay a separate tuition fee which is higher than just upgrading. This incentivizes them to become Tier 3 if they’re serious.
*   *   **Tuition Fee:** Even members might pay a fee for this program because it involves significant instructor effort. We could position it like: Patron members will get 30% off, Champion members can enroll at 20% off, and others (including Tier 1 or external, if allowed) at a higher fee (maybe $500). However, since we want to encourage membership, perhaps we do not open it to non-members at all for now. We could simply say: _Patron – 30% off, Champion – 20% off, Associate – must upgrade to join._ The fee can help compensate instructors or cover materials. We should keep it modest for accessibility if possible and possibly offer scholarships if someone genuinely cannot pay but is very eager (case-by-case).
*   *   **Value for Patrons:** We can discuss making it free for Patrons. It adds tremendous value to Tier 3 membership. It basically could justify the cost alone because comparable online certificate courses often cost hundreds. This is another reason people might become Patrons. Price might need to change
*   *   
**Outcomes:** After completing the program, participants receive a Certificate of Completion of the Advanced Research Program (as discussed earlier). SUAPS can also issue a formal letter detailing what the program covered and possibly the participant’s project title, which they can use in portfolios or even in applications if relevant. We might also, with permission, publish the best capstone projects on SUAPS’s website or annual journal, giving those participants a publication credit (this is a nice incentive for them and also showcases SUAPS’s educational impact).
This formal track will create a cadre of well-trained “alumni” who could become future project leaders, SUAPS volunteers, or even staff. It builds capacity in the community. It also signals that SUAPS is serious about contributing to academic-level discourse on UAPs, even if it’s outside the traditional university system. Over time, if the program is successful, SUAPS might explore forming an _Institute_ or _Academy_ branding around it, and possibly collaborate with academic institutions (for instance, maybe get it recognized as equivalent to some credits in a university continuing ed program).
### **Scalability and Future Development**
In the first iteration, SUAPS might keep the cohort small and fairly manual. In future:
*   If demand grows, could run multiple cohorts or have different tracks (e.g., a beginner vs advanced track).
*   *   Possibly develop an _“instructor training program”_ where alumni of the program who excel can become facilitators for future cohorts, thus scaling instructor capacity.
*   *   Explore partial or full online _conferences or symposiums_ as part of the program, inviting external experts to speak to the cohort (like a mini virtual symposium – which could also be opened to other members as an audience for added value).
*   *   Keep evaluating the program’s effectiveness – gather feedback from participants and refine content and logistics each round.
*   
SUAPS will create a bridge between citizen enthusiasts and formal researchers, enhancing the credibility of both the individuals and the Society and it sets us apart from other organizations in the UAP field.
## **Member-Only Research Participation Platform**
A key aspect of SUAPS’s mission is to involve its members directly in UAP research, not just as learners but as contributors. To achieve this, we will integrate a member-only research participation layer into the membership program. This includes systems for members to submit research proposals, engage in peer review, and collaborate on projects, all supported by community tools (with Slack as a current solution).
The aim is to create a kind of research incubator community within SUAPS, where enthusiasts and scholars can propose ideas (especially feeding into “Phase 0” research), refine them with feedback, and potentially see them developed further with SUAPS support.
### **Research Proposal Submission Process**
Building on SUAPS’s Phase 0 initiative (open call for exploratory research ideas), we will set up a formal yet user-friendly process for members to submit their research proposals:
*   **Standardized Proposal Form:** Develop a template or online form that guides members through crafting a proposal. This form could be a Google Form or a web form on the member portal. It will ask for key elements such as: Title, Objective, Background/Literature, Proposed Methodology, and any support needed. Keeping it structured ensures proposals are comparable and easier to review. Possibly include a section where the member indicates if they need resources or if this is just an idea they’d research themselves.
*   *   **Eligibility:** Tier 3 will take advantage of it. If volume is overwhelming or quality varies, we could consider requiring a certain membership duration, but initially open it up to gather ideas widely.
*   *   **Submission Windows:** We might align with SUAPS’s research cycle (e.g., if Phase 0 calls are annual or biannual). For instance, have two “calls for proposals” per year where members are especially encouraged to submit by a deadline (like Oct 1 and Apr 1). This creates a cadence and batch for review. Outside those windows, we can still accept ideas on a rolling basis, but the formal review happens after each deadline.
*   
### **Collaboration and Development**
Research rarely happens in isolation. The platform should encourage members to team up and develop ideas collaboratively:
*   SUAPS can facilitate a matchmaking: If two proposals are similar, suggest the members collaborate on a merged idea. Or if someone has an idea but lacks a method, connect them with another member who has that skill. Slack channels can help here (like #find-a-collaborator channel).
*   *   Possibly create Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within membership for particular research themes (e.g., one group focusing on UAP imaging analysis, another on historical archives, etc.). These groups meet on Slack or periodic Zoom calls to discuss ideas. They can incubate proposals together. This also ties into the community engagement aspect – members feel part of a research team.
*   *   **Resource Sharing:** Use Google Workspace to share research resources among members – for example, a shared Google Drive folder where members can upload datasets, papers, or code that might be useful for multiple projects. Ensure permissions are members-only. This becomes a mini knowledge base fueling proposals.
*   
### **Community Engagement and Culture**
To make this member-research ecosystem thrive, SUAPS should cultivate a supportive culture:
*   **Acknowledge and celebrate participation:** Shout-outs in the newsletter or Slack for those who submit proposals (“Kudos to Alice, Bob, and Charlie for submitting fascinating Phase 0 ideas!”). Even small digital badges for “Proposal Contributor” could be given. This positive reinforcement will encourage others to take part.
*   *   **Mentorship:** As part of Tier 3 benefits or volunteer roles, experienced researchers (maybe SUAPS senior members or advisors) could volunteer to mentor proposal authors. For example, someone struggling with methodology could get a 1-on-1 session with a SUAPS advisor who guides them. This is high-touch but could be very beneficial. Patrons who themselves are scientists might enjoy mentoring junior enthusiasts – it gives the Patrons a way to engage beyond just consuming content, fulfilling their desire to be active in research.
*   *   **Transparency:** Keep the process transparent. If proposals are being reviewed, communicate timelines and criteria clearly. After selection, publish which proposals were selected and why (with permission). This helps members understand decisions and learn for next time. It also shows SUAPS’s commitment to fairness and scientific merit (like an open grant competition).
*   *   **Integrate with Education:** The research platform and the learning library can reinforce each other. For instance, if many proposals show a gap in understanding statistics, SUAPS can create a course on “Statistics for UAP Research” in the library. Conversely, the formal academic track’s capstone projects might be fed into this pipeline (a participant’s capstone might be essentially a proposal that they partially execute; after the program they could continue it via SUAPS Phase 0 with other members).
*   
In essence, this research participation layer turns membership from a passive experience into an active collaborative environment, which can significantly increase member satisfaction and retention (people will stay if they are invested in projects and relationships formed through them). It also directly furthers SUAPS’s scientific mission by harnessing the brainpower of its membership. Over time, one can imagine SUAPS building a reputation as a hub where credible UAP research ideas germinate – potentially leading to publications or funded projects in later phases. 
## **Implementation Timeline and Roadmap**
This will be detailed once the plan is approved.
## **Conclusion**
This comprehensive plan aims to transform SUAPS’s membership experience into a vibrant three-tier system that educates, engages, and empowers a global community of UAP enthusiasts and researchers. SUAPS can attract and retain supporters while furthering its mission of credible UAP studies.
The combination of a tiered membership model with clear benefits, a “Udemy-style” learning library, a formal academic-like certificate track (cohort-based learning for rigor), and a research participation platform (peer-reviewed member proposals fueling grassroots science) is ambitious yet attainable with careful implementation.
This redesigned program will position the Society for UAP Studies as a leader in member-driven research and education. Members will not only feel that they are receiving great benefits for their dues, but also that they are true partners in the discovery process, accessing knowledge and contributing to it. SUAPS can cultivate a loyal membership base whose collective efforts advance the understanding of UAPs in a serious, scientific manner.

# AURA/UPWARD Initiative

This document proposes integrating the DDRG baseline framework with the newly announced “Research Portfolio Development” initiative, as outlined in the April 16, 2025 memorandum. Introducing this initiative as a new Phase 0 within the DDRG project lifecycle for UAP research will transform our baseline management approach into a dynamic tool for scientific outreach and grassroots funding. The redesigned framework will mimic a product funnel, effectively merging scientific rigor with strategic business principles and modern marketing practices. Phase 0 will enable independent exploratory research without requiring initial donor commitments, creating a strong pipeline to attract and engage donors from Phase 1 onward. Below, I propose a strategy detailing the updated phases, essential team roles, integrated outreach and marketing plans, and an actionable timeline—ensuring transparency, accessibility, and broad public engagement aligned with SUAPS’s mission.
## **1\. Phase 0 Lifecycle: Independent Exploratory Research**
Phase 0 will be a newly defined pre-donor research stage that encourages SUAPS-affiliated researchers to pursue basic and exploratory UAP studies without prior donor or budget approval. This stage corresponds to the “Integrated Research Portfolio Initiative” announced in the SUAPS memo \[_see_: [MEMORANDUM (16 April 2025)](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1E_T3aLpJ1_DU2VLccfv4_BRUBFStGI68Y7qlKTXwItc/edit)\], which invites independent or team-based research proposals by October 1, 2025. Phase 0 will thus serve as an **open incubator** for ideas, laying the groundwork for a unified research portfolio.
**Objectives of Phase 0:** Phase 0’s purpose is to generate and refine research ideas in a low-bureaucracy environment, ensuring that projects are chosen for their scientific merit and curiosity-driven value. Submissions in this phase will form the foundation of SUAPS’s research portfolio, contributing to:
*   **A Unified Research Dossier:** A collection of proposals representing the Society’s collective intellectual capacity across diverse UAP domains (e.g. phenomenology, theoretical physics, psychology of experiences, historical analysis).

*   **A Cohesive Scientific Narrative:** A story of rigorous and innovative inquiry that ties together disparate projects into a meaningful whole. This narrative demonstrates SUAPS’s scholarly legitimacy and exploratory openness.

*   **Pitch-Ready Portfolio for Donors and the Public:** A set of well-defined project concepts that can be presented to potential donors, research allies, and even the general public to attract support.

**Phase 0 Process and Features:** In Phase 0, researchers have full scientific freedom to propose and begin exploratory work on UAP-related questions. Key aspects of this lifecycle include:
*   **Open Call for Proposals:** SUAPS issues an open call (as in the April 2025 memo) for all members, affiliates, and collaborators to submit research ideas by a set deadline (initially October 1, 2025). Submissions use a standardized proposal form currently in development, ensuring consistency in how ideas are presented.

*   **Independent Exploration:** Researchers may conduct preliminary work (literature reviews, small experiments, data gathering) on their own initiative. No formal budget is required at this stage – investigators can leverage personal or institutional resources to explore the feasibility of their ideas. This encourages basic research and creative exploration.

*   **Internal Review & Feedback:** Rather than a donor review, proposals are evaluated by an internal leadership committee for scientific merit and alignment with SUAPS’s mission. Per the memorandum, the [Director of Research Programs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/172YcR5EXOQ9r3PUVQwH_25evbZ1_yeBPtMkYQS6_G34/edit), [Director of Research Grants Development & Administration](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/10dd3azd9cWfDMwLaVx_PpGPJaAjIldJKMGZkKooe2rQ/edit), and Director of Operations will review Phase 0 submissions. This team will provide constructive feedback and logistical support to researchers throughout Phase 0, helping to refine concepts while preserving the researchers’ intellectual independence.

*   **No Donor Gatekeeping:** Projects in Phase 0 do not require donor sign-off to proceed. Researchers can pursue high-risk or unorthodox ideas that might not initially appeal to donors, fostering genuine discovery. The emphasis is on developing the idea to a proposal-ready stage.

*   **Output – Research Portfolio Dossier:** Successful Phase 0 projects culminate in well-crafted research proposals (and possibly preliminary findings) that SUAPS compiles into an Integrated Research Portfolio Master Dossier. This dossier, assembled by internal leadership, will be used for donor pitch decks, public outreach, and strategic alignment of research efforts​. In effect, Phase 0 produces a pipeline of vetted projects ready to enter the formal funded lifecycle in Phase 1 or to be showcased to the public as part of SUAPS’s scholarly brand.

The Society creates a safe space for inquiry driven by curiosity and expertise, ahead of any donor influence. This approach mirrors practices in academia where researchers initiate projects and seek funding after initial groundwork. It is also aligned with SUAPS’s goal of scholarly legitimacy and institutional narrative-building​. Phase 0 will help define SUAPS’s public research identity as an academic society that values professional standards and exploratory openness.
## **2\. Redesign of Phases 1–6 for Donor Engagement and Project Management**
Phases 1–6 will be reframed but still follow industry-standard project management practices (stage-gate reviews, defined deliverables, risk management. The key change is that the origin of projects shifts to Phase 0 (researcher-driven), while Phases 1–6 focus on executing those projects with donor/funding support. This preserves scientific freedom — donors fund and support projects that have already been shaped by researchers — and maintains clear structure and oversight.
Below is an overview of each phase (1–6) under the new model, highlighting donor engagement points and ensuring scientific autonomy is respected:
1. **Phase 1 – Feasibility & Donor Alignment:** Phase 1 now marks the transition from idea to funded project. Projects that emerged from Phase 0 enter Phase 1 when a donor (or SUAPS internal fund) commits to support them. Key activities in Phase 1 include:
2.     *   **Feasibility Study:** The research team now conducts a detailed feasibility analysis. This includes refining the research design, conducting preliminary experiments if needed, finalizing an initial project plan, and ensuring the project is viable within budget and time constraints. SUAPS leadership may approve minor operational support (e.g. access to Society resources or small stipends) without a formal budget vote, to further enable exploration.
    *   **Donor Onboarding:** Matching Phase 0 proposals with interested donors or funding. Donors (or the society’s board, if done by self-funding) are introduced to the project’s objectives and scope. Donors agree to respect the project’s scientific integrity and original aims. Their role is to enable the research, not micromanage it. Any donor-specific goals or constraints are discussed and aligned _before_ project launch, to ensure mutual understanding.
    *   **Budget and Scope Approval:** The project scope, timeline, and budget are formally approved (by SUAPS’s Research Grants Administration and the donor). Phase 1 concludes with a Go/No-Go review – a decision point confirming that the project is feasible and well-planned. This review mirrors industry best practices, ensuring that both the research team and donor are committed and that risks have been assessed before full execution begins.

1. **Phase 2 – Preliminary Definition (Project Planning):** In Phase 2, the project moves into full project planning and preliminary research definition, similar to a “design” phase. With donor funding in place:
2.     *   **Detailed Research Plan:** Researchers develop comprehensive methodologies, experimental designs, or data collection protocols. They may conduct small-scale pilot studies or further literature review to solidify the approach.

*       *   **Team Assembly and Training:** The core project team is assembled or confirmed. If additional expertise or personnel are needed (research assistants, technical staff), they are onboarded. The team ensures all members understand the project objectives and ethical guidelines. If relevant, training on specialized equipment or procedures takes place.

*       *   **Stakeholder Coordination:** Although donors are now stakeholders, scientific freedom is preserved by keeping communications transparent. Donors receive updates on the plan and can provide feedback especially regarding practical considerations (timeline, application of results), but the hypotheses and methods are chosen by the researchers based on best scientific judgment.

*       *   **Project Management Setup:** Standard project management artifacts are created – a detailed work breakdown structure, schedule with milestones, risk management plan, and defined deliverables for each subsequent phase​. This formalizes the industry-standard process. Phase 2 may conclude with an Internal Review of the project plan to ensure it meets scientific standards and is ready for execution.

1. **Phase 3 – Detailed Definition (Pre-Execution):** Phase 3 involves final preparations before full research execution (analogous to final design or prototype phase in engineering projects):
2.     *   **Resource Mobilization:** All necessary resources are secured. This might include procurement of equipment, securing research sites or data sources, finalizing contracts (if external labs or services are involved), and obtaining any regulatory approvals (e.g. ethics board approval for human subject research, permits for field research).

*       *   **Detailed Protocols:** Every aspect of the research protocol is detailed and documented. For example, if the project involves field observations of UAP events, Phase 3 would produce standard operating procedures for how observations are conducted and recorded (multi-sensor setups, calibration routines, etc.). This corresponds to achieving higher Research Readiness Levels (RRLs) – e.g. moving from basic pilot data in Phase 1 to having a robust multi-sensor method ready.

*       *   **Review and Donor Check-in:** Before moving to execution, SUAPS conducts a Phase 3 Review. Donors are briefed on progress and any changes. At this point, costs are more firmly known; if the budget needs adjustment or scope refined, discussions happen under SUAPS oversight to keep the project on track without compromising the research goals. The outcome is a green light to proceed to full execution.

1. **Phase 4 – Core Research Execution:** Phase 4 is where the main research is carried out – equivalent to the “qualification & production” phase. Here:
2.     *   **Data Collection & Experimentation:** The research team executes the plan: conducting experiments, field observations, simulations, etc., as designed. For example, if studying a certain UAP phenomenon, this is the phase where extensive data (e.g. sensor readings, video, witness data) is gathered. The project may reach RRL 5 or higher as it gathers recurrent, pattern-rich data​ that can be analyzed for insights.

*       *   **Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting:** Using standard project management practice, the team tracks progress against milestones. Regular status reports are provided to SUAPS and the donor (frequency might be monthly or per key milestone). These reports focus on factual updates – what data has been collected, any preliminary findings – maintaining transparency. Donors remain informed but do not direct the day-to-day work. If unforeseen challenges arise, the research team leads the problem-solving, while SUAPS ensures the donor understands any implications (e.g. a need to extend duration if phenomena are rarer than expected).

*       *   **Mid-Phase Checkpoints:** For longer projects, interim reviews may be scheduled (e.g. a mid-project review) to evaluate whether adjustments are needed. These are handled professionally via SUAPS’s grants administration processes, ensuring changes are documented and approved without eroding the project’s scientific intent.

1. **Phase 5 – Utilization (Analysis & Dissemination):** In Phase 5, the emphasis shifts to analyzing results and leveraging findings:
2.     *   **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Researchers analyze the collected data using appropriate scientific methods. They test the original hypotheses, draw conclusions, and perhaps identify new questions. This phase might achieve the highest Research Readiness Levels, where patterns are well-understood and results can be compared to existing knowledge or theories.

*       *   **Application of Results:** The project explores how findings can be applied or utilized. In a technological context this might mean developing a prototype or tool; in a research context, it could mean formulating new models or informing policy. For UAP research, “utilization” might involve integrating results into a broader theoretical framework or creating public educational materials if appropriate.

*       *   **Dissemination and Publication:** Importantly, Phase 5 includes writing scientific papers, reports, or monographs. SUAPS will support publication in peer-reviewed journals or through its independent publishing arm (e.g. _Limina_, as referenced in SUAPS communications​). Donors may be acknowledged but do not control the publication contents – academic integrity is preserved in reporting results whether positive, negative, or inconclusive. SUAPS’s commitment to transparency ensures that results are openly shared with the public and scientific community, enhancing credibility.

*       *   **Donor and Public Outreach:** Once results are ready, the donor is provided with a thorough final report and a briefing. At the same time, SUAPS can publicize key findings (through press releases, public talks, or multimedia content) to demonstrate impact. This keeps grassroots supporters engaged (showing them how their early trust paid off) and cements donor relations for future projects.

1. **Phase 6 – Closeout:** The final phase focuses on formally closing the project:
2.     *   **Final Review and Documentation:** SUAPS conducts a Project Closeout Review to ensure all work is completed. All data are archived in a secure, accessible way for future research. Any remaining funds are reconciled and compliance documents completed (with oversight by Grants & Compliance personnel, once that role is filled).

*       *   **Lessons Learned:** The team, along with SUAPS management and the donor if they wish, reviews lessons learned. What worked well? What could be improved in future Phase 0 to Phase 5 cycles? Capturing these insights will help refine the Phase 0 process and subsequent phase execution in the future.

*       *   **Continuation or Handoff:** If the research suggests follow-on projects or requires maintenance (e.g. continuing data collection for long-term monitoring), those are noted. Follow-on efforts would start again at Phase 0 or Phase 1 depending on whether a new donor is needed. In many cases, successful Phase 5 outcomes could inspire new Phase 0 proposals, feeding back into the portfolio development cycle.

*       *   **Public Closure:** Finally, SUAPS communicates the project closure to its community. Supporters are thanked and informed of the overall outcomes – closing the loop of the narrative that began in Phase 0. Donors are recognized (if they consent) as enabling the advancement of knowledge. This transparency and acknowledgement uphold SUAPS’s values of accessibility and public engagement.

**Preservation of Scientific Freedom:** Across Phases 1–6, the research team retains control over scientific decisions and interpretations. Donor involvement is structured and mediated by SUAPS to prevent undue influence on the research direction. For example, donors will not be permitted to alter data or suppress findings – agreements will specify that while they can set broad goals and be informed, the conduct and reporting of research is guided by SUAPS’s ethical standards and peer review. This model of donor partnership, rather than control, ensures projects remain credible and unbiased. It leverages **“**strong mission alignment and independence**”** as a funding strategy, meaning donors are attracted who genuinely support the mission and trust the scientific process.
**Incorporation of Best Practices:** The redesigned phases continue to align with professional project management and research governance:
*   Each phase ends with a review milestone (Go/No-Go decision) to ensure effective planning, risk control, and alignment with objectives.

*   The DDRG’s Research Readiness Level (RRL) framework is maintained as a tool to track research maturity through the phases (from early hypothesis to validated results). Researchers and donors alike can use RRL milestones as a common language to discuss progress.

*   Documentation and Compliance steps are built into phases (e.g., formal proposals, review reports, final archiving) to satisfy both scientific standards and any legal/funding requirements.

With these changes, the DDRG framework evolves into a dual-track, product-funnel system—uniting Society-driven discovery with donor/funding-driven capital and blending scientific inquiry with business discipline and modern marketing tactics.
## **3\. Phase 0 Team Structure: Roles, Responsibilities, and Support**
Launching and maintaining Phase 0 will require a dedicated team and clear governance to manage the influx of independent research proposals, support researchers, and integrate Phase 0 with the rest of the organization’s operations. Below we outline the leadership roles and responsibilities for Phase 0, as well as support requirements for success:

| **Role** | **Key Responsibilities in Phase 0** | **Support Requirements** |
| ---| ---| --- |
| **Director of Research Programs**<br>_(Phase 0 Lead)_ | \- Serve as the Phase 0 Program Lead, overseeing the Integrated Research Portfolio initiative.<br>\- Coordinate the call for proposals, ensuring it reaches all potential contributors.<br>\- Provide academic guidance to researchers: help refine research questions and ensure proposals meet scholarly standards.<br>\- Chair the internal proposal review committee, leading discussions on which proposals to include in the portfolio. | \- **Executive Support:** Empowerment by SUAPS leadership to make decisions on proposal selection and feedback.<br>\- **Administrative Assistance** (e.g., a program coordinator) to help manage communications with dozens of researchers. |
| **Director of Research Grants Development & Admin** | \- Act as the bridge between Phase 0 and funding processes.<br>\- Develop the standardized proposal submission form and review workflow; ensure it is user-friendly and captures info needed for later donor pitches.<br>\- During review, evaluate the feasibility and resource needs of proposals, anticipating what would be required in Phases 1–2 if funded.<br>\- Mentor researchers on how to strengthen proposals from a grants perspective (e.g., clarity of objectives, budgeting for the future). | \- **Tools:** Access to grant management software or at least templates (proposal forms, scoring rubrics).<br>\- **Training:** Stay updated on best practices in grant writing and project planning to coach researchers (e.g., via workshops).<br>\- **Collaboration:** Close coordination with the Research Programs Director to align on feedback given to proposers. |
| **Director of Operations** | \- Provide logistical and operational support for Phase 0 activities.<br>\- Ensure there is infrastructure for proposal submissions (e.g., an online submissions portal or email process, data storage for proposals).<br>\- Manage scheduling and facilitation of review meetings, and coordinate any follow-up actions (such as connecting a researcher with another expert, or providing letters of support if needed).<br>\- Identify any operational needs of proposed projects (e.g., if a proposal needs access to certain equipment or locations during Phase 0, help arrange it if feasible). | \- **IT Support:** A simple **submission platform** (could be as basic as a Google Form or a segment on SUAPS’s website) to collect and organize proposals. Possibly the Operations Director liaises with IT or web staff for this.<br>\- **Logistical Resources:** Ability to allocate meeting space (virtual or physical) for workshops or Q&A sessions with researchers.<br>\- **Budget (Minimal):** A small discretionary fund or resource pool to cover Phase 0 operational costs (e.g., printing proposal materials for committee, or minor expenses for researchers to attend a Phase 0 workshop). |
| **Public Relations (PR) Coordinator**<br>_(Interim Marketing Lead)_ | \- Although not traditionally part of research operations, Phase 0’s success will feed into public outreach. The PR Coordinator (temporarily handling marketing duties) will package the Phase 0 story for external audiences.<br>\- Work closely with the Phase 0 team to identify compelling elements of proposals or researcher stories that can be shared to spark public interest.<br>\- Manage communications about the initiative: announcements on social media, updates on how many proposals have been received, behind-the-scenes looks at the review process, etc., to maintain excitement and transparency.<br>\- Begin crafting the narrative for donor engagement, by highlighting how Phase 0 demonstrates SUAPS’s commitment to rigorous, independent research. | \- **Content Creation Support:** Possibly enlist a writer or multimedia specialist to help produce blogs, videos, or graphics about Phase 0 projects. This ensures the PR Coordinator isn’t overwhelmed and content remains high-quality.<br>\- **Design & Branding:** Access to SUAPS branding assets and any design assistance for creating attractive presentations or social media posts about Phase 0.<br>\- **Coordination with Leadership:** Regular check-ins with the Executive Director and others to ensure messaging aligns with SUAPS’s identity (emphasizing “academic integrity and independence” and “transparency”). |
| **Executive Director / CEO** | \- Champion the Phase 0 initiative at the highest level. In communications with members and external stakeholders, underscore that SUAPS values bottom-up research innovation.<br>\- Provide strategic guidance and conflict resolution if needed (e.g., if internal reviewers disagree strongly on a proposal, or if there’s a question of alignment with SUAPS’s mission).<br>\- Temporarily fulfill gaps in donor relations capacity: since a Development Directo**r** is not yet on staff, the CEO may personally engage with key donors to lay the groundwork for Phase 1 funding of Phase 0 projects. For example, discussing the upcoming research dossier with interested philanthropists or Advisory Board members.<br>\- Approve any necessary resources for Phase 0 (staff time allocations, minor funding needs) to ensure the program’s success. | \- **Board and Advisory Support:** Backing from the Advisory Council and Board to prioritize Phase 0 efforts. They can help by volunteering in proposal reviews or providing mentorship to researchers in their areas of expertise.<br>\- **Delegation Ability:** With many responsibilities, the Executive Director should delegate day-to-day Phase 0 management to the Research Programs Director, stepping in mainly for high-level support.<br>\- **Leadership Communications Platform:** Use of his platform (e.g., memos, meetings, perhaps video messages) to encourage participation in Phase 0 and later, to urge donors to support the portfolio. |

In addition to the above leadership roles, the researchers themselves are key members of the Phase 0 ecosystem. Each proposing team or individual should be considered a part of the SUAPS research community. It may be wise to set up a peer support system among Phase 0 participants – for example, periodic virtual meetups where researchers can share ideas or challenges, moderated by the Research Programs Director. This creates a sense of community and shared purpose, reinforcing that Phase 0 is a collaborative endeavor, not a competition.
**Support Infrastructure:** To implement Phase 0 smoothly, a few additional support elements are recommended:
*   **Submission & Tracking System:** A lightweight project intake system is needed to track all proposals, their status through review, and eventual outcomes. This could be done with google forms and Clickup maintained by the Operations Director, and eventually evolve into a more sophisticated grant management tool if volume grows.

*   **Documentation and Templates:** Provide clear guidelines to researchers for Phase 0: a proposal template (outlining expected sections like background, hypothesis, methodology, any preliminary work, etc.), evaluation criteria transparency (so researchers know how their proposal will be judged), and timeline of the review process. Templates for feedback forms will help reviewers give structured input.

*   **Phase 0 Committee Meetings:** Schedule regular (e.g. monthly) meetings of the Phase 0 leadership team to monitor progress. Early on, these meetings will focus on outreach (ensuring enough proposals are coming in) and later on, reviewing submissions. A collaborative workflow tool (ClickUp) can allow the three directors to comment on proposals asynchronously as part of the “streamlined internal review workflow”.

*   **Advisory Involvement:** Once SUAPS’s Advisory Council is fully constituted (targeted by late summer 2025), consider involving select advisors in Phase 0 as expert reviewers or mentors. They can lend subject-matter expertise to strengthen proposals, and their participation underscores the seriousness of the initiative to external observers.

Overall, the Phase 0 team structure leverages existing leadership roles and fills gaps via interim assignments to ensure all needed functions (scientific oversight, grant development, operations, outreach) are covered. A clear chain of responsibility, with the Director of Research Programs as the Phase 0 lead, will keep the initiative focused. Ensuring this team has the necessary support – administrative help, tools, and executive backing – is crucial, especially given that some key positions (e.g. Marketing, Development) are in the process of being filled. The timeline below addresses how and when to augment this team as SUAPS’s capacity grows.
## **4\. Grassroots Marketing and Donor Engagement Strategy**
To support Phase 0 and the broader research portfolio, SUAPS will implement an integrated grassroots marketing and donor engagement strategy. This strategy takes inspiration from successful crowd-supported projects like _“The Chosen”_ TV series, which achieved unprecedented levels of fan funding through creative outreach. It aims to build a sustainable base of public support and connect with donors in a way that preserves scientific integrity while exciting a general audience. Key components of the strategy include choosing the right platforms, employing effective storytelling, crafting compelling pitches, and using tools to measure success.
### **4.1 Platform Selection for Outreach**
Reaching a broad audience requires meeting people where they are. A multi-platform approach is recommended, each serving a specific role in engagement:
*   **YouTube:** Leverage the existing Society channel (~30k subs) as a primary outlet for video content. YouTube is ideal for posting short documentaries, expert interviews, or animated explainers about UAP research. For Phase 0, one idea is a series of “Inside the UAP Research Lab” videos highlighting intriguing proposals or profiling researchers (with their permission). Regular video content can both educate the public on UAP science and create a personal connection to the researchers. YouTube also allows monetization and memberships, potentially generating some revenue. Importantly, it’s a discovery platform – engaging videos can attract viewers who then follow links to SUAPS’s site or donor pages.

*   **Instagram:** Use Instagram (cross-posting to Facebook) for more frequent, visual updates. Instagram’s strengths are in storytelling via images, short videos (Reels), and infographics. SUAPS can share infographics explaining UAP concepts, photos of researchers in the field or at work (humanizing the science), and milestone updates (e.g. “We received 50 proposals for Phase 0!” with a graphic). Instagram skews toward a younger demographic, which is useful for building future long-term support. It’s also a platform where science communicators often thrive by simplifying complex ideas into visual carousels. Ensuring posts maintain **scientific accuracy** while being accessible is key – for example, a carousel post might debunk a common misconception about UAPs in lay terms, ending with an invitation to “learn more about our research”.

*   **Twitter (X):** Can be useful for real-time updates and connecting with the science and tech community. SUAPS can tweet about interesting UAP facts, live-tweet during significant events (e.g., if there’s a notable UAP-related news story, the SUAPS account can add an expert take), and share links to longer content. It’s also an avenue to engage in conversation with influencers or journalists covering space, aviation, or science news.

*   **Patreon or Membership Platform:** To facilitate regular grassroots contributions, set up a Patreon page or a similar membership model (alternatively, SUAPS could implement its own membership subscription on its website). Patreon allows fans to support the organization with small monthly amounts (e.g., $4, which is in line with SUAPS’s grassroots target) in exchange for insider updates or perks. Using Patreon, SUAPS can offer tiers of support, for example: _Member_ ($4/month) gets a monthly insider newsletter and name listed on a “supporter wall”, _Champion_ ($10/month) gets access to quarterly private webinars with research leaders, etc. The key is to make supporters feel like part of the missio**n**. This mimics the _“pay-it-forward”_ approach The Chosen used via its app – many people giving a little to collectively enable big projects. A Patreon platform provides transparency (supporter count, funding progress) and community features (patrons-only posts, comments) that keep donors engaged.

*   **Substack or Blog (Newsletter):** A newsletter serves as a more intimate storytelling medium and a call-to-action driver. For example, a weekly or biweekly Substack could feature a “Researcher’s diary” from someone in Phase 0 discussing their work in layperson terms, or an editorial from the Director of Research Programs about why a particular line of inquiry is exciting. Substack allows free and paid subscriptions; SUAPS might keep it free for wider reach, but encourage Patreon-style support separately. The mailing list built here is valuable for any future fundraising campaigns (e.g., when Phase 0 projects graduate to Phase 1, an email blast can announce, “Project X is now seeking funding – here’s how you can help make it happen!”).

*   **Website and Online Community:** Ensure the main SUAPS website is kept up-to-date with a section dedicated to the Research Portfolio (Phase 0 projects). Each project could have a short description and progress updates, demonstrating transparency.

*   **Live Events (Streaming):** Platforms like YouTube Live, Instagram Live, or Zoom webinars can host periodic live Q&A sessions with SUAPS scientists or leadership. For example, a “Phase 0 Update Livecast” every two months where the team answers questions from the public and shares exciting developments. This interactive element boosts trust and lets potential donors see the genuine passion and expertise of the researchers.

*   **Other Platforms:LinkedIn** (to reach professional circles and potential institutional donors with more formal updates) and **TikTok** (if aiming to capture a younger audience with bite-sized science facts, though TikTok content would need careful curation to remain serious yet catchy). These are optional and can be phased in as the outreach team grows.

**Consistency across Platforms:** All these channels should have a cohesive branding and message. SUAPS’s communications plan already emphasizes cohesive branding across research and outreach. Visual identity (logos, design schemes) and tone of voice (professional yet accessible, inspiring curiosity) should be uniform. A content calendar can synchronize posts: e.g., a new YouTube video is promoted via Twitter and Instagram with teaser clips, and referenced in the newsletter. Cross-platform promotion ensures maximum reach and reinforces the message.
### **4.2 Storytelling Techniques Balancing Rigor and Accessibility**
Engaging a general audience without compromising on scientific rigor is a delicate art. SUAPS should adopt storytelling techniques that educate, inspire, and invite support. A great model to emulate is the style of _Big Think_, which is known for delivering expert-driven content in a compelling way​. Big Think’s approach – short, thought-provoking segments featuring experts – shows that complex ideas can be made relatable. Here are key storytelling principles for SUAPS:
*   **Lead with the Big Picture:** Always start by answering the question, _“Why should the public care?”_ For each Phase 0 project or UAP topic, open with the broader significance. For example: “What are UAPs, and why do they matter to science and society?” or “This project could change how we understand flight physics.” By front-loading the big ideas or implications, you hook the audience’s curiosity. Technical details can follow once interest is piqued.

*   **Use Clear, Jargon-Free Language:** All content should be in plain English with minimal scientific jargon. If technical terms are needed, they must be explained succinctly. The goal is not to dumb down the science, but to translate it. As communication experts note, even words scientists take for granted can be misunderstood by general audiences​. SUAPS presenters should practice speaking slowly, clearly, and with enthusiasm – more like explaining to an interested friend rather than lecturing a class. This approach retains rigor (you’re still conveying accurate concepts) but ensures understanding.

*   **Show the Human Side of Science:** Stories resonate when they involve people. SUAPS should highlight the personal journeys of its researchers and the mystery they are tackling. For example, a short article or video might profile a team in Phase 0: “Meet Dr. X, an atmospheric scientist pursuing an unexplained phenomenon she witnessed as a child. Now, through SUAPS, she’s investigating it formally.” By weaving personal motivation or anecdotes into the narrative, the audience connects emotionally. This is similar to how _The Chosen_ built a community by sharing behind-the-scenes looks at the creators and actors – making supporters feel personally invested.

*   **Maintain Scientific Rigor:** While simplifying language, don’t oversimplify the science. SUAPS should fact-check all public content. If a hypothesis is unproven, say so; if there are alternate explanations, acknowledge them. This honesty builds trust. One technique is to let researchers speak in their own words (edited for clarity) – their passion and honesty will shine through. Another is to incorporate analogies: compare an unfamiliar concept to something known​ (“Detecting a UAP is a bit like tuning a radio – you have to filter out lots of noise to find the signal” – a rough analogy for signal processing in data). Good analogies make abstract ideas concrete without distorting the facts.

*   **Use Multi-Media Storytelling:** Don’t rely only on text. Use images, diagrams, and video wherever possible to illustrate points. A short animation can depict, say, how a particular sensor array works to capture UAP data. Data visualizations can show sighting patterns. Visuals help convey information quickly and stick in memory. For example, an infographic titled “7 Levels of UAP Research Readiness” could graphically show the progression from basic observation to applied science, which simultaneously educates the viewer and implicitly advertises the sophistication of SUAPS’s approach.

*   **Narrative Framing – The Journey of Discovery:** Frame the research portfolio as an ongoing journey or quest. Every piece of content can remind the audience that _“we are uncovering the unknown, step by step, and you can come along on this journey.”_ A classic narrative structure (akin to a hero’s journey) could be applied: The challenge (mysteries of UAPs), the heroes (SUAPS researchers and indeed citizen supporters who join), the obstacles (lack of mainstream funding, need for data), and the reward (advancing human knowledge, maybe even groundbreaking discoveries). This doesn’t mean inventing drama, but rather highlighting the inherent drama of real scientific exploration.

*   **Inspire Participation and Ownership:** The tone should invite the public not just to passively consume content, but to participate. Phrases like “Join us in exploring…” or calls to action such as “What questions do _you_ think we should ask?” in a social media post can make people feel included. SUAPS can run occasional campaigns like “Ask a UAP Scientist” where the public submits questions. By interacting, people move from being viewers to community members. This participatory storytelling was key in projects like The Chosen – fans felt they were part of something historic. In SUAPS’s case, supporters should feel they are contributing to a historic scientific endeavor.

*   **Credibility through Transparency:** Given the controversial nature of UAPs, SUAPS must be transparent to gain trust. If a particular project didn’t find any anomalous result, that should be candidly shared as part of the story (“negative results are results too”). When supporters see that SUAPS isn’t chasing sensationalism but is truly scientific and scholarly, it boosts the credibility of all communications. This ties into SUAPS’s emphasis on transparency and accessibility in communications.

SUAPS can emulate the accessibility of outlets like Big Think and the community engagement of The Chosen, all while maintaining its identity as a serious research institution. The content should always respect the audience’s intelligence and desire for truth, even as it excites their imagination.
### **4.3 Pitch Templates and Narrative Framing for Donors**
A critical part of this strategy is converting public interest into tangible support. This involves crafting pitches and narratives tailored for different contexts: from a 280-character tweet, to a 2-minute video, to a 20-minute donor presentation. I recommend developing versatile pitch templates that can be adapted as needed, ensuring consistency in the core message. Here’s a breakdown:
*   **Social Media Micro-Pitches:** For platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or short videos, focus on clear, concise messages that can stand alone but also entice further inquiry. A template for these could be: Hook + Value Proposition + Call-to-Action. For example, a tweet might say: _“Meteors that change direction mid-flight? 🔍 Our scientists are investigating the impossible. SUAPS supports bold UAP research grounded in science – be part of the discovery.​_” followed by a link to learn more or donate. The hook (mysterious meteors) grabs attention, the value proposition (bold research grounded in science) assures credibility, and the CTA invites engagement. Every post should subtly reinforce _why SUAPS’s work is exciting and worthy_.

*   **Donor Deck (Slide Presentation) Template:** For more formal pitches to major donors or sponsor organizations, prepare a slide deck structure that can be reused for different meetings. A recommended narrative flow:

1.     1. **Problem/Opportunity:** Start by framing the big questions about UAPs and why they matter now. E.g., “UAPs present an unanswered question at the frontiers of science and aerospace safety. Few organizations study this rigorously – SUAPS fills that gap.” Use facts or statistics if available to quantify the opportunity (number of sightings, public interest level, etc.).
    2. **Mission & Credibility:** Introduce SUAPS and Phase 0. Emphasize SUAPS’s scholarly approach (many proposals, internal review, ties to academic standards) to establish credibility. Mention the integrated portfolio as a cohesive program​file-hqaeueurzfhrvmebrxhebj, not random projects – this shows strategic vision.
    3. **Stories of Innovation:** Highlight 2–3 example projects (from Phase 0 proposals) that are especially likely to captivate the donor. For each, tell a mini-story: what the research hopes to find and why it’s groundbreaking or impactful. For instance, “Project A is designing a sensor network to catch UAP data at multiple points – it could set a new standard for data collection​. Project B is analyzing historical records in Latin America – it might rewrite parts of UFO history.” These examples make the portfolio tangible.
    4. **Scientific Freedom + Donor Role:** Explain how donors will be involved – “From Phase 1 onward, your support makes these projects possible.” Assure them their contributions empower independent research rather than buying predetermined outcomes. This is a good place to reference the _dual-track funding model_ where donor-directed projects run alongside society-initiated efforts, showing this approach is part of SUAPS’s strategy.
    5. **Impact and Recognition:** Paint the vision of success. What will the world know or have if these projects succeed? E.g., “Within 2 years, we could have the largest dataset of multi-sensor UAP observations in the world, open for scientific analysis.” Connect this to the donor: “By investing in SUAPS, you will have catalyzed this leap in knowledge – and you’ll be recognized as a key partner in advancing human understanding.” Some donors are inspired by altruistic impact, others by prestige; this framing covers both.
    6. **The Ask:** Clearly state what is needed. For a big donor, it could be: “We are seeking $X to fund Phase 1 and 2 of these five top projects.” Also mention grassroots success to date: e.g., “Our community of 5,000 small supporters is contributing monthly, demonstrating public backing. Your leadership gift would amplify this and fully launch the program.” This shows the donor that their money leverages an existing movement (nobody wants to be the only one supporting something).
    7. **Next Steps:** End with how they can get involved immediately – an invitation to visit the lab, meet the scientists, or simply a follow-up meeting to discuss details. Make it easy for them to say yes.
*   **Narrative Framing in Written Donor Materials:** For grant proposals or letters to foundations, a more formal narrative is used, but still storytelling is important. Start such documents with a executive summary that reads like a story: “In 2025, a group of dedicated scientists noticed a gap… SUAPS was formed to bring academic rigor to UAP studies… Now, an ambitious new portfolio of 20 independent research projects stands ready, awaiting the resources to unlock answers.” This engages even a time-strapped foundation officer to read on. Throughout, maintain a tone that is confident, professional, and passionate. Use data and references (like any preliminary results from Phase 0) to back claims. Including quotes or testimonials can also strengthen narrative – for example, a quote from a researcher: _“This funding would allow me to test a theory I’ve been developing for 10 years,”_ or from a community supporter: _“I donate $5 a month because I believe SUAPS will find the truth.”_ Such voices add authenticity.

*   **Consistency and Customization:** While templates provide a base, always tailor the pitch to the audience. A tech entrepreneur donor might be excited by the advanced sensor tech; a philanthropic foundation might care more about educational impact or public benefit. Have a repository of slides or stories that can be swapped in. But ensure the core identity – SUAPS as rigorous, innovative, and public-minded – is constant in all narratives.

*   **Authority:** In some pitches, it may help to reference thought leaders or big ideas to contextualize SUAPS’s work. For example, frame a slide with a quote from a well-known scientist about the importance of exploring the unknown, or cite how mainstream interest in UAPs is growing (government reports, academic conferences). This connects SUAPS to the broader intellectual landscape, showing donors that supporting SUAPS is supporting a cutting-edge, credible movement.

*   **Storytelling for Smaller Donors:** Not all donors will be large; many may come from the grassroots outreach. For them, the “pitch” is essentially the ongoing content stream. Ensure every video or blog has a subtle pitch embedded – e.g., a YouTube video ends with, “If you found this interesting and want to see more research like this happen, consider joining our supporter community.” On Patreon or the website, have a clear, inspiring message about what their monthly donation enables (“Your $4 a month piles up with others’ to fund open research that might solve mysteries of the universe – truly, _big things have small beginnings_”).

Overall, the narrative framing across all pitches should tell a unified story of SUAPS: a bold, community-supported venture that’s tackling one of the most intriguing questions of our time in a serious way. Donors, whether big or small, should come away feeling that by supporting SUAPS, _they become part of an historic journey of discovery_. This emotional and intellectual buy-in will drive sustained support.

### **4.4 Tools for Managing and Measuring Outreach Success**
To ensure the grassroots marketing and donor engagement strategy is effective, SUAPS will employ various tools to manage outreach efforts and measure success. Monitoring progress allows the team to refine tactics and demonstrate outcomes to leadership (and donors). Key tools and metrics include:
*   **Social Media Analytics:** Each platform provides insights – YouTube Studio for video metrics (views, watch time, subscriber growth), Instagram/Facebook Insights for engagement (likes, shares, reach of posts), Twitter Analytics for tweet impressions and interactions. The team should track these monthly. For example, monitor how a particular YouTube series performs: Do explainer videos get more watch-time than interviews? Use this data to guide content strategy (double down on what works). A metric of success could be subscriber count on YouTube (with a goal to reach, say, 10k subscribers in the first year) and follower counts on other platforms, but more importantly engagement rates (a smaller but highly engaged audience is better than a huge indifferent one). High engagement means the content is resonating.

*   **Web and Conversion Analytics:** Use Google Analytics (or an equivalent) on the SUAPS website and any campaign landing pages. This will show how traffic arrives (e.g. did a spike in visits correspond to a particular article or media mention?), and track behaviors like newsletter sign-ups or clicks to the Patreon link. Set up conversion goals – e.g., number of users who click “Donate” or sign up for the newsletter. The team can identify drop-off points and improve them (maybe the donation page was too confusing – analytics can highlight that). The open/click rates of emails are key metrics for how compelling your messaging is to those who already opted in.

*   **Donor Management CRM:** As the grassroots donor base grows, managing relationships is crucial. Early on ClickUp, Wix or Patreon’s built-in tools might be enough for tracking supporters. But as soon as feasible, we should consider adopting a CRM system for nonprofits. This will keep track of donor information, donation history, and interactions. It also helps segment the audience – for example, identify which supporters are highly engaged (opening every email, commenting on posts) and might be cultivated for larger contributions or volunteer roles. The CRM can remind the team to send personalized thank-yous or updates to certain donors, enhancing retention.

*   **Engagement Tools:** Tools like Hootsuite or Buffer for scheduling social media posts and monitoring mentions. This not only saves time by managing multiple platforms in one dashboard, but also provides reports on combined social reach. Another tool category is community management – our Slack could be used to set up a community chat for supporters.

*   **Content Performance Metrics:** Beyond high-level social stats, dive into content-specific data. On YouTube, see audience retention graphs for each video (where do viewers drop off?). On the blog, see which posts are most read (time on page) or most shared. This helps refine storytelling: maybe people share human-interest stories more than technical briefings – then make sure to incorporate human elements even in technical updates. Tools like Hotjar can even show how people scroll and interact with pages, giving qualitative insight.

*   **Surveys and Feedback:** Metrics are not just quantitative. Use surveys to get feedback from the community. Send an annual survey to all newsletter subscribers asking what topics they found most interesting, or why they support SUAPS. Or poll social media followers on what they’d like to see more of. This direct feedback can be invaluable and sometimes will catch things metrics don’t (like a particular misconception that needs addressing, or interest in a new platform).

*   **KPIs and Dashboard:** Establish a set of KPIs for outreach, and review them in team meetings (perhaps the Phase 0 team plus the PR/Comms team). Sample KPIs: Monthly new supporters (Patreon or other), Monthly donation revenue, Social engagement rate (% of followers who interacted), Newsletter open rate, Number of proposals that mention “came via public suggestion” (if community starts contributing ideas), etc. Visualize these in a simple dashboard or report that can be shared with SUAPS leadership. This keeps everyone accountable and allows celebrating successes (e.g., “We gained 500 new supporters in six months, which is 10% of our 95k target – a great start!”).

*   **A/B Testing and Iteration:** Use tools to test different approaches. For example, an email marketing tool can send two versions of a subject line to see which gets higher opens. Try different styles of social media posts (one with a statistic vs. one with a quote) and compare engagement. Over time, these experiments will hone the effectiveness of messaging. Keep a log of what has been learned (a “growth experiments” document) so new team members can pick up on strategies that work or don’t work.

By deploying these tools and practices, SUAPS can manage its outreach like a science—collecting data, testing hypotheses (in this case, about what outreach methods work), and continuously improving. In fact, being able to show that “we have X thousand engaged supporters and our content is viewed by millions” adds weight to SUAPS’s credibility during pitches. It demonstrates a thriving public interest that any donor would be excited to tap into.
Lastly, measuring success should always tie back to the ultimate goals: funding the research and advancing knowledge. So the most important metrics will be: Did Phase 0 attract a strong portfolio of research? Is grassroots funding steadily increasing toward our goal (95k supporters at $4/month)? Are Phase 0 projects successfully transitioning to funded Phase 1 projects? Those are the measures of success that this entire strategy is designed to achieve.
## **5\. Timeline and Steps for Implementation**
The final part of this plan is a timeline that lays out how SUAPS can begin executing Phase 0 and its supporting strategies as soon as possible, considering the organization’s current state and leadership readiness. The timeline below breaks down key steps from now (Q2 2025) through the next year, aligning with known milestones (such as the October 2025 proposal deadline) and incorporating the need to fill leadership roles​file-hqaeueurzfhrvmebrxhebj. Each step is designed to build momentum so that Phase 0 is up and running quickly and effectively.

| **Timeframe** | **Key Activities & Milestones** |
| ---| --- |
| **Immediate (April–May 2025)** | \- **Finalize Phase 0 Leadership Assignments:** Confirm that the Director of Research Programs will lead Phase 0, and officially form the internal review committee (including the Directors of Grants Dev & Admin and Operations). Communicate these roles to all involved.<br>\- **Interim Coverage for Vacant Roles:** Since the Director of Marketing and Development Director positions are approved but unfilled, assign interim responsibilities. The PR Coordinator will temporarily lead marketing/outreach efforts​, and the Executive Director (or a board member) will handle major donor relations.<br>\- **Launch the Call for Proposals:** Publicize the Integrated Research Portfolio Initiative to all SUAPS members and affiliates. This likely was initiated via the 16 April memo, but reinforce it with direct communications (emails to members, announcement on the website and forums). Include clear instructions and the October 1, 2025 deadline for submissions. Make the proposal submission form available if ready, or at least release guidelines and let researchers start preparing.<br>\- **Set Up Submission Infrastructure:** Create a dedicated email or online form for Phase 0 proposal submissions. Ensure the Operations team tests it for reliability.<br>\- **Initial Outreach Teasers:** Through social media and the SUAPS website, announce that SUAPS is “opening the floodgates” for new research ideas. Tease this development to the public without full detail (to start generating curiosity and show SUAPS is active). For example, a tweet or post: _“Big things coming – SUAPS to unveil a research initiative that YOU can be a part of. Stay tuned.”_ This preps the ground for the grassroots marketing push. |
| **Q2 2025 (June 2025)** | \- **Marketing & Community Launch:** Roll out the grassroots engagement channels. Publish an introductory blog post or video explaining Phase 0 in an exciting way to the general public. Perhaps title it “Democratizing UAP Research: SUAPS Phase 0 Begins” and explain in simple terms that scientists are submitting their best ideas to study UAPs, and the public can follow along. Accompany this with launching the Patreon (or chosen membership platform) and newsletter.<br>\- **Content Schedule Kick-off:** Begin a regular schedule for content. Maybe a weekly update (small news or facts) on Instagram/Twitter, a biweekly YouTube video or livestream (starting with an “Ask Me Anything about UAP Research” featuring the Exec Director or Research Director), and a monthly newsletter. The exact frequency can adjust to capacity, but consistency is key.<br>\- **Researcher Support:** Host a Q&A session or webinar for prospective Phase 0 participants. This is an internal event where interested researchers can ask the leadership committee about the process, get guidance on crafting proposals, etc. It shows support and may improve quality of submissions. If resources allow, record this and possibly share excerpts publicly to showcase the excitement brewing among scientists.<br>\- **Hire/Onboard Critical Staff (if possible):** Aim to post job listings or accelerate recruitment for the Development Director and Director of Marketing roles. Hiring could take a few months, but starting now is important. Highlighting the momentum SUAPS is building (e.g., “we have X proposals coming in, X followers gained since April”), it may also attract strong candidates. |
| **Q3 2025 (July–September 2025)** | \- **Continued Content & Outreach:** Through the summer, keep the outreach engine running. Share behind-the-scenes looks at Phase 0: “Meet the Researcher” spotlights, short interviews with those preparing proposals (showcasing diversity of topics), and educational segments on UAP-related science to keep broad audience interest. As more people learn of SUAPS, aim to steadily grow the supporter base (e.g., target a certain number of Patreon supporters by September as a milestone).<br>\- **Refine Proposal Intake Workflow:** As per the memo’s milestone, by late summer the team should refine the internal workflow for handling proposals. This includes finalizing the review criteria and scheduling the review process. If many submissions are expected, decide how to maybe enlist additional reviewers or set up a two-stage review (initial screening, then detailed review). Also ensure that by September, leadership roles are solidified or newly hired staff are integrated. For instance, if a Director of Marketing comes on board by August, they should quickly ramp up on the Phase 0 outreach and possibly take over from the PR Coordinator in pushing the campaign.<br>\- **Community Building:** Consider hosting a mid-point virtual event, like a “Research Portfolio Mid-Summer Update” livestream. Share how many proposals have been received so far, maybe give a sneak peek of a cool idea (with the researcher’s consent), and thank the community for their support. Use this event to remind everyone of the October 1 deadline (for researchers) and to rally more public support (“only 1 month left for our scientists to submit their ideas – and for you to join our supporter community before the next phase!”).<br>\- **Finalize Review Panel Logistics:** By September, lock in the dates in October for the internal review of proposals​file-hqaeueurzfhrvmebrxhebj. Make sure all review committee members (Research Programs, Grants Admin, Operations, possibly any advisors) have those days blocked. Plan the **format of the final dossier** – perhaps a template for how each proposal will be summarized for donors – so that compilation in Q4 is streamlined. |
| **Key Milestone: Oct 1, 2025** | \- **Phase 0 Submission Deadline:** On October 1st, ensure a smooth close to the call for proposals. Acknowledge receipt of each submission with a polite confirmation email (this fosters goodwill among researchers). Tally the total number of submissions and the breadth of topics. Publicly, this is a moment to celebrate: announce _“\[Number\] proposals from researchers around the world have been submitted – showcasing an incredible range of UAP research ideas!”_ This demonstrates the vibrant response and builds anticipation for what comes next. If the number is impressive, definitely highlight it on social media and the website.<br>\- Internally, secure all submissions and prepare them for evaluation (organize them, possibly anonymize for unbiased review if appropriate). This kicks off the next phase: turning these proposals into a polished portfolio. |
| **Q4 2025 (October–December 2025)** | \- **Internal Review & Dossier Compilation (Oct–Nov):** As planned, conduct the internal review of Phase 0 proposals during October and November​file-hqaeueurzfhrvmebrxhebj. The committee should score or rank proposals, provide feedback to researchers (where possible – even those not selected for donor pitching should get constructive feedback for their effort). Then begin compiling the Research Portfolio Master Dossier. This dossier may be a comprehensive document or a set of materials, but by end of November it should be in draft form. Include an executive summary, sections for each major research theme, and the individual project summaries. Aim for a cohesive, compelling document that can double as a donor pitch booklet and a public-facing booklet (perhaps with sensitive details or IP removed if needed for public version).<br>\- **Donor Pitch Materials (Oct–Nov):** In parallel, start creating tailored pitch decks and donor engagement materials. For example, for a planned December meeting with a potential major donor, prepare a presentation focusing on the top few projects that match their interest. Also consider a more general “portfolio pitch” deck that can be sent to multiple donors. If SUAPS plans any end-of-year fundraising push (common in nonprofit sector around holidays), tie that into the narrative – e.g., a “support the future of UAP research” campaign in late November or December, showcasing the newly compiled portfolio and inviting year-end gifts.<br>\- **Communications & Public Reveal:** Once the dossier is compiled (perhaps by late November), SUAPS can unveil the Research Portfolio to the public (at least in part). This could be done via a media release or a special event. For instance, hold a virtual showcase where the top proposals are presented by the researchers in short lightning talks, open to the public and press. This demonstrates transparency and generates buzz. It’s also a prime moment to drive donations: viewers can be reminded that these projects will only move forward with support.<br>\- **Leadership & Governance Milestones (Late 2025):** Around late summer or early fall, SUAPS anticipated a general meeting and Advisory Council confirmation. By Q4, incorporate any guidance from these governance events. If the Advisory Council has formed, brief them on the Phase 0 outcomes and enlist their help in donor networking. The general meeting (if not already happened) could be used to formally ratify the DDRG Baseline Document. |
| **Early 2026 (Jan–March 2026)** | \- **Phase 1 Project Kick-offs:** As soon as donor commitments are secured for specific projects, initiate those projects into Phase 1 of the lifecycle. Ideally, by early 2026, a few of the most promising Phase 0 proposals have found funding (some may get funded sooner, even in late 2025, depending on donor interest). Conduct Phase 1 feasibility meetings for those projects and formally launch them. This will be a major achievement to communicate: “Project X from our portfolio is now officially funded and underway!” Publicize these wins, as success breeds success (both in morale and in attracting more donors).<br>\- **Continued Donor Outreach:** Use the momentum from the portfolio release to continue pitching throughout early 2026. Some donors (especially institutional or larger foundations) might move slower in decision-making; keep engaging them with follow-up information, answering questions, perhaps inviting them to visit a lab or an observation site if relevant. The goal is to gradually convert the entire Phase 0 portfolio into funded projects over time.<br>\- **Phase 0 Next Cycle Planning:** After the first iteration of Phase 0, evaluate and improve. Plan the next call for proposals (if SUAPS intends Phase 0 to be an annual or continuous program). Incorporate lessons learned: for example, maybe adjust the timeframe (was October a good deadline or should it be earlier to align with donor budget cycles?), expand outreach to more researchers if certain domains were underrepresented, etc. Announce the next round to keep the pipeline flowing.<br>\- **Community Engagement Maintenance:** The grassroots community built in 2025 needs to be nurtured in 2026 and beyond. Continue regular content, and show outcomes. For example, create update videos on funded projects as they progress (this retains supporters’ interest and attracts new ones who see that SUAPS doesn’t just talk, it delivers results). Perhaps start a tradition of an annual “State of UAP Research” address or report that highlights what Phase 0 + donors have accomplished. |

This timeline is aggressive but feasible. It factors in SUAPS’s current stage of growth. It also aligns with the key date of October 1, 2025 for proposal submissions and ensures that by the end of 2025, SUAPS has a tangible product (the research portfolio) to show donors and the public.
By starting now (Spring 2025) with internal organization and outreach ramp-up, SUAPS can capture the excitement from recent announcements and convert it into action. The phased timeline ensures that each step builds on the previous: first generating proposals and community interest, then packaging those into fundable projects, and finally launching those projects with donor support. Throughout this schedule, the dual goals of preserving scientific integrity and engaging supporters remain front and center. This way, when SUAPS leadership stands in front of stakeholders at the next general meeting or donor event, we can demonstrate a fully realized Phase 0 program already bearing fruit – truly a **“**bold stride toward global scholarly engagement**”**.
